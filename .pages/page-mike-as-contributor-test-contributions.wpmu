<p>I tried writing a post and it's in the pipe for review.</p>
<p>'Mike' was not able to create or edit posts in his role as 'Contributor', so Michael has now promoted him to Editor.  With that role, Mike needs to be very careful and only edit pages that he has been requested to.  There is a safety net since Michael uses Git to change track everything in this site and we can roll back revisions as needed.   </p>
