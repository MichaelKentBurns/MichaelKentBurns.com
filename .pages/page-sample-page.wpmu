<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Software development freelancing...</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many locations around the globe that are hotspots for software development.   If you happen to live in one of those places, jobs can come looking for you.   But there are many places around the world that have little or no jobs in this field.  In those places you need some extra skills to get and keep work, but it can be done.  This site is a place to find help and to build community of fellow developers.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My intention with this main page is to tell a story of a journey that you might be on.  I'll try to keep it pretty brief and include "Learn more..." links so you can dive deeper as you need.   Hopefully you will find yourself on this journey and find where you are in the story.  When you do, I invite you to contact me.  My intention is that I can help guide you along.   I hope that this will become a community of like minded people.  I invite you to help me understand your needs and together we will keep you moving.  No tricks or fees are involved.   See my <a href="https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/about-michael/" data-type="page" data-id="22">About page</a> for that background.  If you have questions or comments along the way please <a href="mailto: MichaelKentBurns@gmail.com">email me</a>.   This site is a work in progress and I intend to develop it to meet the needs of my readers. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Developing your skills</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While traditional full time employment brings a degree of long term job security, freelancers need to keep their current skills fresh in order to stay relevant.  High tech work is constantly changing with new fields opening up almost daily.  Those new fields often have a higher demand for skilled individuals.  Being willing and able to add new skills will increase your chances of finding work and better pay.  </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Front end web</h4>

<p>The World Wide Web is a rapidly evolving place, and it is a challenging field to stay fresh in.   Sometimes there are dramatic shifts in interactive technology.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the advent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software"><strong>open-source software</strong></a> there arose the need to have world wide access to the source code for the many projects.   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git"><strong>Git</strong></a> is the source control tool invented for Linux development.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub"><strong>GitHub</strong></a> is a web interface for software development which uses Git for the source control features, and describes itself as collaborative version control.   It not only allows you to manage your own projects but lets you share them.  Furthermore it lets you explore a vast galaxy of other projects that you can learn from, and in some cases contribute to.  That is a great way of building your reputation. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding work as an individual</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer">freelance</a> marketplaces online.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/">Upwork</a> is one we recommend.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Working as part of a team</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of the rapid pace of technology development and market requirements, most web and application development is done by integrated teams.  No one person can do it all themselves. It takes a team of specialists working individually and cross discipline to be successful. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A team can take on big jobs that a single person cannot do.   This presents opportunity for the individual developer.  Once you understand how a team can work together you can find the best place to contribute.   But while you are doing what you already know how to do, you will also learn something about the rest of the team and the roles they fill.   And you will find avenues to learn new skills while you build team skills.   </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Development platforms</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Doing web development work as an individual can be done with most any computer running Windows, Linux, or Macintosh.   You most likely already made a choice and are doing work.   However, as you move into full stack work, or start working as part of a team it will get more complex.   It is worth considering the options again. </p>
