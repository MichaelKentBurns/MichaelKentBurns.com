<p>I first met Destin in Bukavu in May 2023 during my first visit.  He impressed me then with his breadth of knowledge in web development.  His review of this site has solidified that impression.  He has a wealth of information and does his research very thoroughly.   As a result I invited him to edit the <a href="https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/full-stack/" data-type="page" data-id="55">Full stack</a> page and give it much needed material.  He has done that well and has come up with much more material that needs to be added in several other pages.   So, stay tuned for those enhancements.  </p>
