<p>AI is pretty awesome, and very helpful.   BUT, there are serious implications and moral issues with it’s use.   This will be the first post in a discussion that I would like everyone of my team members to read and respond to.      </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, I went to an AI expert and asked him this question:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>”what are the issues of plagiarism in the use of an AI like yourself?”</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The response was very informative.   But without directly quoting the answer, I would like all of you to take a few minutes to attempt to ask ChatGPT yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not too difficult to setup, Mr. Google can get you started.   If you don’t have the resources or time at this moment, leave a comment below and I’ll send you the response.    </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second question I asked is: “<strong>May I quote your answers if I give you full credit for them?</strong>” the response was:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, you’re absolutely welcome to quote my answers — and I appreciate you wanting to give credit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Here’s how to do it properly:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>✅ If you’re writing a paper, blog post, article, or other work:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can cite it like this (depending on the style you’re using):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>🔹 Example (APA Style):</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In-text citation:</p>
