## Software development freelancing…

There are many locations around the globe that are hotspots for software development. If you happen to live in one of those places, jobs can come looking for you. But there are many places around the world that have little or no jobs in this field. In those places you need some extra skills to get and keep work, but it can be done. This site is a place to find help and to build community of fellow developers.

Learn a little about me and why I am developing this site on my About page…

## Welcome

My intention with this main page is to tell a story of a journey that you might be on. I’ll try to keep it pretty brief and include “Learn more…” links so you can dive deeper as you need. Hopefully you will find yourself on this journey and find where you are in the story. When you do, I invite you to contact me. My intention is that I can help guide you along. I hope that this will become a community of like minded people. I invite you to help me understand your needs and together we will keep you moving. No tricks or fees are involved. See my About page for that background. If you have questions or comments along the way please email me. This site is a work in progress and I intend to develop it to meet the needs of my readers.

This is a live WP site, it explains itself.

## Like any good repository, this one has this README.md which tells you:
* What the project does
  It helps me mentor young developers who may know web design (or other software development fields) but lack the experience of working as part of a team in a global endeavor.  
* Why the project is useful
  It not only describes the journey a developer goes on while maturing, but it demonstrates the process through participating. I am actively involved in each students journey. 
* How users can get started with the project
  Start reading and respond as suggested in the text.  If you are serious, I will respond.  
* Where users can get help with your project
  Contact me through the site and I'll guide you.
* Who maintains and contributes to the project
  I personally do, along with some of my mentees as described in [https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/about-michael/contributors/](my contributors page)
