<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Software development freelancing...</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many locations around the globe that are hotspots for software development.   If you happen to live in one of those places, jobs can come looking for you.   But there are many places around the world that have little or no jobs in this field.  In those places you need some extra skills to get and keep work, but it can be done.  This site is a place to find help and to build community of fellow developers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Learn a little about me and why I am developing this site on my <a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/about-michael/"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""22"">About page...</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1 class=""wp-block-heading"">Welcome</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My intention with this main page is to tell a story of a journey that you might be on.  I'll try to keep it pretty brief and include ""Learn more..."" links so you can dive deeper as you need.   Hopefully you will find yourself on this journey and find where you are in the story.  When you do, I invite you to contact me.  My intention is that I can help guide you along.   I hope that this will become a community of like minded people.  I invite you to help me understand your needs and together we will keep you moving.  No tricks or fees are involved.   See my <a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/about-michael/"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""22"">About page</a> for that background.  If you have questions or comments along the way please <a href=""mailto: MichaelKentBurns@gmail.com"">email me</a>.   This site is a work in progress and I intend to develop it to meet the needs of my readers. </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Developing your skills</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While traditional full time employment brings a degree of long term job security, freelancers need to keep their current skills fresh in order to stay relevant.  High tech work is constantly changing with new fields opening up almost daily.  Those new fields often have a higher demand for skilled individuals.  Being willing and able to add new skills will increase your chances of finding work and better pay.  </p>

<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">Front end web</h4>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the advent of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software""><strong>open-source software</strong></a> there arose the need to have world wide access to the source code for the many projects.   <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git""><strong>Git</strong></a> is the source control tool invented for Linux development.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub""><strong>GitHub</strong></a> is a web interface for software development which uses Git for the source control features, and describes itself as collaborative version control.   It not only allows you to manage your own projects but lets you share them.  Furthermore it lets you explore a vast galaxy of other projects that you can learn from, and in some cases contribute to.  That is a great way of building your reputation. </p>

I can also get some feedback from you on what is helpful and what is not so much.  Eventually, I would like you to consider being more actively involved in making this site a place where you can help others and learn from them too. </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Finding work as an individual</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a number of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer"">freelance</a> marketplaces online.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/"">Upwork</a> is one we recommend.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Working as part of a team</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of the rapid pace of technology development and market requirements, most web and application development is done by integrated teams.  No one person can do it all themselves. It takes a team of specialists working individually and cross discipline to be successful. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A team can take on big jobs that a single person cannot do.   This presents opportunity for the individual developer.  Once you understand how a team can work together you can find the best place to contribute.   But while you are doing what you already know how to do, you will also learn something about the rest of the team and the roles they fill.   And you will find avenues to learn new skills while you build team skills.   </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Development platforms</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Doing web development work as an individual can be done with most any computer running Windows, Linux, or Macintosh.   You most likely already made a choice and are doing work.   However, as you move into full stack work, or start working as part of a team it will get more complex.   It is worth considering the options again. </p>

<p>He is now happily retired, but not yet done with the field.  This site is home base for his new focus of mentoring programmers in the art of software engineering.   The main emphasis is individuals living in a places that do not have software development jobs.  This means that their best opportunity is to go freelance.   Doing so allows them to stay in their culture and home community.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While freelancing is a start, there are also opportunities to do so much more as part of a larger development team focused on many open source software projects.   This is something that I am moving into myself.  Join me.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Software development freelancing...</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many locations around the globe that are hotspots for software development.   If you happen to live in one of those places, jobs can come looking for you.   But there are many places around the world that have little or no jobs in this field.  In those places you need some extra skills to get and keep work, but it can be done.  This site is a place to find help and to build community of fellow developers.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Developing your skills</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While traditional full time employment brings a degree of long term job security, freelancers need to keep their current skills fresh in order to stay relevant.  High tech work is constantly changing with new fields opening up almost daily.  Those new fields often have a higher demand for skilled individuals.  Being willing and able to add new leading edge skills will increase your chances to find work and will often pay much better.  </p>

<p>Front end, or<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development""> front-end web development</a> refers to the skills and technology related to building pages and applications that run in a web browser.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Skills</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a number of skills to learn in order to be a typical web designer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Almost all of them can be learned at a number of mentor sites.  One of which is <a href=""https://www.frontendmentor.io"">FrontendMentor</a>.  That site (and others like it) have a wealth of information and tutorials that teach you the fundamentals and details of all of these skills.   After reading this page and exploring FrontendMentor some, I recommend you try one of their challenges yourself.     </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking ahead, in our page on <a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/work-globally/"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""59"">Work globally…</a> there is a challenge to do one of the FrontendMentor challenges and capture your process and final work in a GitHub repository that you can show off what you have learned.   Keep an eye out for that, as it is a very important step in your professional development. </p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"">HTML</a> is a rich markup language which can be viewed and coded in a simple text editing program.   It consists of the text to be presented interspersed with HTML markup tags that specify how that text should be displayed.   The filename usually ends in either .htm or .html to indicated that it can be displayed in a web browser.  The HTML markup standards have been around since the beginning of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"">World Wide Web.</a>  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">HTML5</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5"">HTML5</a> is simply the 5th major revision of the HTML standards that added significant modern features that make some web pages very dynamic. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics.   While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale.   If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent.  Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish.   The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only.   A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives.   If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one.    A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database.  But, that is another subject for another day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">JavaScript - A procedural programming language for web pages.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript"">JavaScript</a> is a programming language inspired by Java that is meant to run inside a web page.   All of the actual work is performed by the web browser itself. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As discussed above, all of the above technologies can run on any computer with a web browser.  The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer.   You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive.  Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class=""wp-block-code""><code>&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then using your file browser (Windows explorer or Mac Finder) to locate that file and open it as you would any other document. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes, that is all that is needed.  However, that does not make any use of the internet or the World Wide Web.   The ""World Wide"" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=""http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm"">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.   The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol.  After that the ':' indicates the beginning of the location of the resource which usually starts with '//' followed by the name of the resource.   Try it yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>There are plenty of resources to learn full stack skills.  Just see Wikipedia's ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend"">Frontend and backend</a>"" page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it seems obvious that full stack includes both front end and back end skills there is more to it.   The most obvious is the issue of deployment and configuration.  After all the front end (web page) needs to know how to connect to the back end server.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fortunately, there are many cloud platforms that provide all of these services and integration and deployment into a simple ""one click"" service.    This WordPress site is running on a single core, Cloudways VPS (virtual private server) in a <a href=""https://www.vultr.com"">Vultr </a>datacenter in Seattle, Washington.   In fact that VPS hosts several WordPress sites as well as other technologies I am playing with. </p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It is free</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It is open source</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It is widely used (43% of all websites on the internet use WP)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It is very flexible since it is a general website builder, a content management system, and a blogging platform all rolled into one. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It is fairly easy to use</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It is the platform I am using to build this site</li>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">GitHub</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the advent of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software""><strong>open-source software</strong></a> there arose the need to have world wide access to the source code for the many projects.   <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git""><strong>Git</strong></a> is the source control tool invented for Linux development, but it is now widely used on all platforms, operating systems, and languages.    I actually use Git to control the source of this entire WordPress site. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are command line versions of git for all major desktop systems.  One of the more popular graphical interfaces for git is <a href=""https://desktop.github.com""><strong>GitDesktop</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub""><strong>GitHub</strong></a> is a web interface for software development which uses Git for the source control features, and describes itself as collaborative version control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>GitHub</strong> supports the creation of personal accounts.  Each account can contain a number of repositories, which can be made public or private access.   A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer's personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.   As work progresses on the local machine and certain testable milestones are reached, the local changes can be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To get an idea of how this looks visit <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns"">my GitHub account.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.   Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all that in mind you should take action now by taking my <a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/challenge-setup-your-own-github-account-and-install-desktop-github-app/"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""187"">Challenge: Setup your own GitHub account and install Desktop GitHub app</a>.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Capture your learning in a repository.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many tutorial sites to help you learn new skills.  As an example look at <strong><a href=""https://www.frontendmentor.io"">Frontend Mentor.</a></strong>  It is a good practice to capture your work for each challenge in a GitHub repository.  While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional about utilizing the features of Git.    </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you begin a challenge, you should create a GitHub repository and do all of your work step by step capturing your work as you go.    </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you are ready to try that, go to<a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/challenge-capture-a-tutorial-project-in-a-github-repository/""> the challenge page</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to update the ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, update your resumé, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Create a project with other developers.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you learn with your friends take the opportunity to propose an original project that you all can work on together.   Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.   This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about it. </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resumé or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>

<p>There are many locations around the globe that are hotspots for software development.   If you happen to live in one of those places, jobs can come looking for you.   But there are many places around the world that have little or no jobs in this field.  In those places you need some extra skills to get and keep work, but it can be done.

High tech work is constantly changing with new fields opening up almost daily.  Those new fields often have a higher demand for skilled individuals.  Being willing and able to add new leading edge skills will increase your chances to find work and will often pay much better.  </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While traditional full time employment brings a degree of long term job security, freelancers need to keep their current skills fresh in order to stay relevant.  High tech work is constantly changing with new fields opening up almost daily.  Those new fields often have a higher demand for skilled individuals.  Being willing and able to add new leading edge skills will increase your chances to find work and will often pay much better.  </p>

<p>While it seems obvious that full stack includes both front end and back end skills there is more to it.   The most obvious is the issue of deployment and configuration.  After all the front end (web page) needs to know how to connect to the back end server.  </p>

<p>Fortunately, there are many cloud platforms that provide all of these services and integration and deployment into a simple ""one click"" service.    This WordPress site is running on a single core, Cloudways VPS (virtual private server) in a <a href=""https://www.vultr.com"">Vultr </a>datacenter in Seattle, Washington.   In fact that VPS hosts several WordPress sites as well as other technologies I am playing with. </p>

<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.   Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Capture your learning in a repository.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many tutorial sites to help you learn new skills.  As an example look at <strong><a href=""https://www.frontendmentor.io"">Frontend Mentor.</a></strong>  This site is helpfully setup to capture your work for each challenge in a GitHub repository.  While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional in utilizing the features of Git.    </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you begin a challenge, you should </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Create a new repository to house it.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Download the initial codebase provided, and push that to GitHub as your starting point.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Take the first step in the challenge, then test it, and finally push that work.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Test all the features you have done so far during the challenge.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>If you find a bug or perhaps a new feature or enhancement, stop and create an issue in the repository.   You don't have to fix it immediately, but it is very important to record the issue and steps to reproduce it.  </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Continue your work stepwise capturing each step by pushing it with a descriptive comment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Finally, or during the course of your work, look at the outstanding issues and pick one or two to address.  As each is fixed push the fix and close the issue. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to create a ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, update your resumé, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Create a project with other developers.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you learn with your friends take the opportunity to propose an original project that you all can work on together.   Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.   This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about. </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resumé or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>

<p>While you are looking for jobs you will need to make sure you choose jobs that you can do in such a way that the client is pleased and you get good reviews.   Do not include skills in your profile that you are not already proficient in.   On the other hand, you should keep your eye out for jobs that you can collaborate on with someone you trust.   If you have a friend that has a good reputation and you can work together you can learn about working as part of a team.  But be very careful because any failure can damage your reputation.  </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Software development freelancing...</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many locations around the globe that are hotspots for software development.   If you happen to live in one of those places, jobs can come looking for you.   But there are many places around the world that have little or no jobs in this field.  In those places you need some extra skills to get and keep work, but it can be done.  This site is a place to find help and to build community of fellow developers.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Developing your skills</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While traditional full time employment brings a degree of long term job security, freelancers need to keep their current skills fresh in order to stay relevant.  High tech work is constantly changing with new fields opening up almost daily.  Those new fields often have a higher demand for skilled individuals.  Being willing and able to add new leading edge skills will increase your chances to find work and will often pay much better.  </p>

<p><strong>GitHub</strong> supports the creation of personal accounts.  Each account can contain a number of repositories, which can be made public or private access.   A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer's personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.   As work progresses on the local machine and certain testable milestones are reached, the local changes can be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.</p>

<p>To get an idea of how this looks visit <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns"">my GitHub account.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.   Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>

It consists of the text to be presented interspersed with HTML markup tags that specify how that text should be displayed.   The filename usually ends in either .htm or .html to indicated that it can be displayed in a web browser.

<p>As discussed above, all of the above technologies can run on any computer with a web browser.  The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer.   You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive.  Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class=""wp-block-code""><code>&lt;HTML>
&lt;H1>Hello World!&lt;/H1>

<p>Sometimes, that is all that is needed.  However, that does not make any use of the internet or the World Wide Web.   The ""World Wide"" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the WorldWideWeb you simply enter a web address such as http://MichaelKentBurns.com/About.html into the search or address bar of your browser.   The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol.  After that the ':' indicates the beginning of the location of the resource which usually starts with '//' followed by the name of the resource.   Try it yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific. page (About.html).  That server located the file for that page and other associated information and sent it back to your browser running on your computer.  Your browser then formatted it according to the HTML rules and you then see the results. </p>

<p>There are many locations around the globe that are hotspots for software development.   If you happen to live in one of those places, jobs can come looking for you.   But there are many places around the world that have little or no jobs in this field.  In those places you need some extra skills to get and keep work, but it can be done.  This site is a place to find help and to build community of fellow developers.</p>

<p>My intention with this main page is to tell a story of a journey that you might be on.  I'll try to keep it pretty brief and include ""Learn more..."" links so you can dive deeper as you need.   Hopefully you will find yourself on this journey and find where you are in the story.  When you do, I invite you to contact me.  My intention is that I can help guide you along.   I hope that this will become a community of like minded people.  I invite you to help me understand your needs and together we will keep you moving.  No tricks or fees are involved.   See my <a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/about-michael/"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""22"">About page</a> for that background.

<p>With the advent of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software""><strong>open-source software</strong></a> there arose the need to have world wide access to the source code for the many projects.   <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git""><strong>Git</strong></a> is the source control tool invented for Linux development.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub""><strong>GitHub</strong></a> is a web interface for software development which uses Git for the source control features, and describes itself as collaborative version control.</p>

<p><strong>GitHub</strong> supports the creation of personal accounts.  Each account can contain a number of repositories, which can be made public or private access.   A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer's personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.   As work progresses on the local machine and certain testable milestones are reached, the local changes can be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.</p>

<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.   Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>

<p>There are plenty of resources to learn full stack skills.  Just see Wikipedia's ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend"">Frontend and backend</a>"" page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it seems obvious that full stack includes both front end and back end skills there is more to it.   The most obvious is the issue of deployment and configuration.  After all the front end (web page) needs to know how to connect to the back end server.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fortunately, there are many cloud platforms that provide all of these services and integration and deployment into a simple ""one click"" service.    This WordPress site is running on a single core, Cloudways VPS (virtual private server) in a <a href=""https://www.vultr.com"">Vultr </a>datacenter in Seattle, Washington.   In fact that VPS hosts several WordPress sites as well as other technologies I am playing with. </p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It is free</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It is widely used (43% of all websites on the internet use WP)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It is very flexible since it is a general website builder, a content management system, and a blogging platform all rolled into one. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It is fairly easy to use</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">GitHub</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the advent of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software""><strong>open-source software</strong></a> there arose the need to have world wide access to the source code for the many projects.   <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git""><strong>Git</strong></a> is the source control tool invented for Linux development.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are command line versions of git for all major desktop systems.  One of the more popular graphical interfaces for git is <a href=""https://desktop.github.com""><strong>GitDesktop</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub""><strong>GitHub</strong></a> is a web interface for software development which uses Git for the source control features, and describes itself as collaborative version control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>GitHub</strong> supports the creation of personal accounts.  Each account can contain a number of repositories, which can be made public or private access.   A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer's personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.   As work progresses on the local machine and certain testable milestones are reached, the local changes can be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To get an idea of how this looks visit <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns"">my GitHub account.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.   Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Capture your learning in a repository.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many tutorial sites to help you learn new skills.  As an example look at <strong><a href=""https://www.frontendmentor.io"">Frontend Mentor.</a></strong>  This site is helpfully setup to capture your work for each challenge in a GitHub repository.  While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional in utilizing the features of Git.    </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you begin a challenge, you should </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Create a new repository to house it.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Download the initial codebase provided, and push that to GitHub as your starting point.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Take the first step in the challenge, then test it, and finally push that work.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Test all the features you have done so far during the challenge.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>If you find a bug or perhaps a new feature or enhancement, stop and create an issue in the repository.   You don't have to fix it immediately, but it is very important to record the issue and steps to reproduce it.  </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Continue your work stepwise capturing each step by pushing it with a descriptive comment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Finally, or during the course of your work, look at the outstanding issues and pick one or two to address.  As each is fixed push the fix and close the issue. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to create a ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, update your resumé, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Create a project with other developers.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you learn with your friends take the opportunity to propose an original project that you all can work on together.   Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.   This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about it. </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resumé or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best way to build your skills as a team player and move up to more responsible positions is to find a role that you can already fill and join a team.   With a little effort you will be able to learn more about the other team members and their roles as well as learn more about the larger project.   As you develop your skills you can build a reputation of trust.   Open source software projects are a great opportunity because they depend on volunteer contributions.  But, it should be noted that all work done for open software projects is not done for free.  The companies or organizations that rely on open source software often have specific needs that are not necessarily shared by the community at large.   These organizations will often pay their employees, or outside developers, to work on their special needs.  A close friend of mine does exactly this at SAS where I retired from. </p>

With a little effort you will be able to learn more about the other team members and their roles as well as learn more about the larger project.   As you develop your skills you can build a reputation of trust.   Open source software projects are a great opportunity because they depend on volunteer contributions.  But, it should be noted that all work done for open software projects is not done for free.  The companies or organizations that rely on open source software often have specific needs that are not necessarily shared by the community at large.   These organizations will often pay their employees, or outside developers, to work on their special needs.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many open source projects are dependent on other open source projects.  Working on one can give you valuable skills and understanding that can be a gateway to other projects.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, you can build relationships with other developers and learn of other opportunities.  </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">GitHub</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the advent of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software""><strong>open-source software</strong></a> there arose the need to have world wide access to the source code for the many projects.   <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git""><strong>Git</strong></a> is the source control tool invented for Linux development.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are command line versions of git for all major desktop systems.  One of the more popular graphical interfaces for git is <a href=""https://desktop.github.com""><strong>GitDesktop</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub""><strong>GitHub</strong></a> is a web interface for software development which uses Git for the source control features, and describes itself as collaborative version control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>GitHub</strong> supports the creation of personal accounts.  Each account can contain a number of repositories, which can be made public or private access.   A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer's personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.   As work progresses on the local machine and certain testable milestones are reached, the local changes can be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To get an idea of how this looks visit <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns"">my GitHub account.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.   Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Capture your learning in a repository.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many tutorial sites to help you learn new skills.  As an example look at <strong><a href=""https://www.frontendmentor.io"">Frontend Mentor.</a></strong>  This site is helpfully setup to capture your work for each challenge in a GitHub repository.  While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional in utilizing the features of Git.    </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you begin a challenge, you should </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Create a new repository to house it.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Download the initial codebase provided, and push that to GitHub as your starting point.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Take the first step in the challenge, then test it, and finally push that work.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Test all the features you have done so far during the challenge.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>If you find a bug or perhaps a new feature or enhancement, stop and create an issue in the repository.   You don't have to fix it immediately, but it is very important to record the issue and steps to reproduce it.  </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Continue your work stepwise capturing each step by pushing it with a descriptive comment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Finally, or during the course of your work, look at the outstanding issues and pick one or two to address.  As each is fixed push the fix and close the issue. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to create a ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, update your resumé, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Create a project with other developers.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you learn with your friends take the opportunity to propose an original project that you all can work on together.   Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.   This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about it. </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resumé or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many locations around the globe that are hotspots for software development.   If you happen to live in one of those places, jobs can come looking for you.   But there are many places around the world that have little or no jobs in this field.  In those places you need some extra skills to get and keep work, but it can be done.  This site is a place to find help and to build community of fellow developers.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My intention with this main page is to tell a story of a journey that you might be on.  I'll try to keep it pretty brief and include ""Learn more..."" links so you can dive deeper as you need.   Hopefully you will find yourself on this journey and find where you are in the story.  When you do, I invite you to contact me.  My intention is that I can help guide you along.   I hope that this will become a community of like minded people.  I invite you to help me understand your needs and together we will keep you moving.  No tricks or fees are involved.   See my <a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/about-michael/"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""22"">About page</a> for that background.  If you have questions or comments along the way please <a href=""mailto: MichaelKentBurns@gmail.com"">email me</a>.

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While traditional full time employment brings a degree of long term job security, freelancers need to keep their current skills fresh in order to stay relevant.  High tech work is constantly changing with new fields opening up almost daily.  Those new fields often have a higher demand for skilled individuals.  Being willing and able to add new skills will increase your chances to find work and will often pay much better.  </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While traditional full time employment brings a degree of long term job security, freelancers need to keep their current skills fresh in order to stay relevant.  High tech work is constantly changing with new fields opening up almost daily.  Those new fields often have a higher demand for skilled individuals.  Being willing and able to add new skills will increase your chances to find work and will often pay much better.  </p>

<p>With the advent of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software""><strong>open-source software</strong></a> there arose the need to have world wide access to the source code for the many projects.   <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git""><strong>Git</strong></a> is the source control tool invented for Linux development.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub""><strong>GitHub</strong></a> is a web interface for software development which uses Git for the source control features, and describes itself as collaborative version control.</p>

<p><strong>GitHub</strong> supports the creation of personal accounts.  Each account can contain a number of repositories, which can be made public or private access.   A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer's personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.   As work progresses on the local machine and certain testable milestones are reached, the local changes can be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.   Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'll not bother to describe all the many programs needed for each of these platforms since that will be found in the Development Tools page.   Rather, I'll discuss some of the unique attributes of each and how they relate.   You have probably already chosen a favorite platform, but may also be considering some alternatives.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Linux</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Almost all web hosting servers are running Linux so ultimately if you are going to do full stack development you will need to learn Linux.   Many developers have chosen to also use Linux as their local work computer.  We will discuss hosting servers a little later on this page, but for now we will consider Linux as a local development computer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Linux of course can be installed on PC's and Macintoshes.   It can be installed in a virtual machine on either of those platforms.   It also can run native on Windows using <a href=""https://cygwin.com"">Cygwin</a> which gives an existing Windows user the ability to use both Windows apps and Linux apps interchangeably.   That also eases the Linux learning curve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>MacOS is based on Unix and the Mac Terminal app depends on Unix (Linux) shells for line mode interactive commands.   There are many different shells available to choose from, but the most commonly used one in my experience is BASH.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you choose to run Linux as your native OS then you will almost always a graphical user interface.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Windows</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Windows you naturally have a graphical interface include Windows Explorer,  a web browser like Edge, an interactive command line tool like PowerShell or cmd.exe.   Using your browser there are applications galore that you can download and install.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition as mentioned above you can also install <a href=""https://cygwin.com"">Cygwin</a> and get lots of Linux goodies as well.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Macintosh</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As mentioned above MacOS is really UNIX under the covers.   The Terminal window runs many different UNIX shells.   Many common development tools are available for download and install and ready for use.     </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, since Terminal gets you into the core of UNIX there are many UNIX, and Linux package managers available that will let you install just like you are in Linux.  Homebrew is one option.   Just Google '<a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/?hps=1&amp;q=package+managers+for+mac&amp;ia=web"">package managers for mac</a>'</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Web hosting servers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most servers are virtual machines in a cloud server farms.   These are almost always headless meaning there is no display and keyboard.   You must access  these using some form of secure shell.   Checkout a google of '<a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ssh&amp;t=osx&amp;ia=web"">ssh</a>'.   ssh and many programs that use it require secure certificates to be generated and installed on your local machine.  I will have a whole 'How to' page dedicated to secure networking. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">How about you? </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Give all of those options you probably already have a development platform of some sort and it's now time to talk about it.     I need to know about your setup, your needs, and your questions.    I have a '<a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/challenge-tell-me-about-your-development-setup/"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""184"">Tell me about your development setup</a>' challenge page that you can use to tell me all about it.

<li>Visit my page:  <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns"">https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns</a> and checkout some of my repositories.   One you might find interesting is <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/MichaelKentBurns.com"">MichaelKentBurns.com</a> which is the project which is the repository for this site.   Yes, I keep an entire WordPress site captured in a repository.  </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Also checkout the repository in which I captured the process I went through in developing my next challenge:  <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/Challenge-Interactive-rating-component"">Challenge-Interactive-rating-component</a>, look at the text of the file Notes.md to see how I did it. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Note that the GitHub site is where the public facing copy of your repository is stored.  But, you don't want to do your work there, in fact you can't.  Instead the idea is that you create a copy of that repository locally on your own machine and develop in that copy.     There are two ways to upload your progress at each step on the way.  One is the original 'git' cli command.   That requires a little learning which is not a bad idea.  But there is a companion Desktop app that looks a lot like the GitHub.com site.  It is called <a href=""https://desktop.github.com/"">GitHub Desktop</a>.  You can download that from this link now and install it.  Alternatively, once you have created your first repository and want to 'clone' it to your desktop machine, the cloning process will offer to install the desktop app for you and feed it the command to do the copy of your new repository.   </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>To get a feel for how this works, take the time to create a 'my first repo' repository and clone it to your desktop machine.   Then code a simple 'HelloWorld.html' page.  If you are not familiar with ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program"">Hello, World!</a>"" checkout the wikipedia page.  There you will find source for this simple starter app in almost any language known, including HTML.   When you have coded it, then use the desktop app to commit that and push it to your public repository.   </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Once you have it working locally and have pushed it to the GitHub site you can actually create a 'GitHub Page' to publish the working page for the whole world to see.   To do that when looking at the repository in GitHub.com, you will see a number of tabs along the top:  '&lt;> Code', 'Issues', ... 'Settings'.   Pick the Settings.   It will automatically fill in the repository name, and the Default branch will probably be set to 'main'.    On the left side of the screen in the sidebar, under 'Code and automation' there is an item named 'Pages'.  Pick that.   Once there it's pretty easy.  Under 'Source' there is a selector to pick the branch.   That should already say 'Deploy from a branch'.   Leave that as it is.  Below that is a section labeled 'Branch'.  In there are two buttons that should say 'None' and 'Save'.  It is not real obvious but click the 'None' button and select the 'main' branch'.  Finally press the 'Save' button.   It should then tell you 'Your GitHub Pages site is currently being built from the <code>main</code> branch. <a href=""https://docs.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/"">Learn more about configuring the publishing source for your site</a>.'  In a few moments you can refresh that page and see a note near the top that says something like 'Your site is live at <a href=""https://michaelkentburns.github.io/Hello-World/"">https://michaelkentburns.github.io/Hello-World/</a>Last <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/Hello-World/actions/runs/7922504847"">deployed</a> by <img width=""14"" height=""14"" src=""https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5041124?s=28&amp;v=4"" alt=""@MichaelKentBurns""><a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns"">MichaelKentBurns</a> 1 minute ago'.   Just click that link or the 'Visit site' button. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Now that it is published live, you can make a small change to your local copy of the program and commit and push that to GitHub and within a short time your change will be live.   On the right side of the repository page, near the bottom you will see a section labeled 'Deployments'.  </li>

<p>In my <a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/work-globally/"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""59"">Work globally</a> page I discuss the importance of using GitHub to make yourself known and show off your talents.  It is also a great place to discover other projects that you can learn from and teams that you can participate in. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Go to <a href=""http://GitHub.com"">GitHub.com</a></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Read up on what it is and how it works.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Click the 'Sign up' button and create yourself a free account. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Search around for projects that interest you and get a feel for how they are layed out.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Visit my page:  <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns"">https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns</a> and checkout some of my repositories.   One you might find interesting is <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/MichaelKentBurns.com"">MichaelKentBurns.com</a> which is the project which is the repository for this site.   Yes, I keep an entire WordPress site captured in a repository.  </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Also checkout the repository in which I captured the process I went through in developing my next challenge:  <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/Challenge-Interactive-rating-component"">Challenge-Interactive-rating-component</a>, look at the text of the file Notes.md to see how I did it. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Note that the GitHub site is where the public facing copy of your repository is stored.  But, you don't want to do your work there, in fact you can't.  Instead the idea is that you create a copy of that repository locally on your own machine and develop in that copy.     There are two ways to upload your progress at each step on the way.  One is the original 'git' cli command.   That requires a little learning which is not a bad idea.  But there is a companion Desktop app that looks a lot like the GitHub.com site.  It is called <a href=""https://desktop.github.com/"">GitHub Desktop</a>.  You can download that from this link now and install it.  Alternatively, once you have created your first repository and want to 'clone' it to your desktop machine, the cloning process will offer to install the desktop app for you and feed it the command to do the copy of your new repository.   </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>To get a feel for how this works, take the time to create a 'my first repo' repository and clone it to your desktop machine.   Then code a simple 'HelloWorld.html' page.  If you are not familiar with ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program"">Hello, World!</a>"" checkout the wikipedia page.  There you will find source for this simple starter app in almost any language known, including HTML.   When you have coded it, then use the desktop app to commit that and push it to your public repository.   </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Once you have it working locally and have pushed it to the GitHub site you can actually create a 'GitHub Page' to publish the working page for the whole world to see.   To do that when looking at the repository in GitHub.com, you will see a number of tabs along the top:  '&lt;> Code', 'Issues', ... 'Settings'.   Pick the Settings.   It will automatically fill in the repository name, and the Default branch will probably be set to 'main'.    On the left side of the screen in the sidebar, under 'Code and automation' there is an item named 'Pages'.  Pick that.   Once there it's pretty easy.  Under 'Source' there is a selector to pick the branch.   That should already say 'Deploy from a branch'.   Leave that as it is.  Below that is a section labeled 'Branch'.  In there are two buttons that should say 'None' and 'Save'.  It is not real obvious but click the 'None' button and select the 'main' branch'.  Finally press the 'Save' button.   It should then tell you 'Your GitHub Pages site is currently being built from the <code>main</code> branch. <a href=""https://docs.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/"">Learn more about configuring the publishing source for your site</a>.'  In a few moments you can refresh that page and see a note near the top that says something like 'Your site is live at <a href=""https://michaelkentburns.github.io/Hello-World/"">https://michaelkentburns.github.io/Hello-World/</a>Last <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/Hello-World/actions/runs/7922504847"">deployed</a> by <img width=""14"" height=""14"" src=""https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5041124?s=28&amp;v=4"" alt=""@MichaelKentBurns""><a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns"">MichaelKentBurns</a> 1 minute ago'.   Just click that link or the 'Visit site' button. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Now that it is published live, you can make a small change to your local copy of the program and commit and push that to GitHub and within a short time your change will be live.   On the right side of the repository page, near the bottom you will see a section labeled 'Deployments'.  </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>

<p>You have probably done this now!  Congratulations.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the advent of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software""><strong>open-source software</strong></a> there arose the need to have world wide access to the source code for the many projects.   <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git""><strong>Git</strong></a> is the source control tool invented for Linux development.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are command line versions of git for all major desktop systems.  One of the more popular graphical interfaces for git is <a href=""https://desktop.github.com""><strong>GitDesktop</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub""><strong>GitHub</strong></a> is a web interface for software development which uses Git for the source control features, and describes itself as collaborative version control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>GitHub</strong> supports the creation of personal accounts.  Each account can contain a number of repositories, which can be made public or private access.   A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer's personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.   As work progresses on the local machine and certain testable milestones are reached, the local changes can be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To get an idea of how this looks visit <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns"">my GitHub account.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.   Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all that in mind you should take action now by taking my <a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/challenge-setup-your-own-github-account-and-install-desktop-github-app/"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""187"">Challenge: Setup your own GitHub account and install Desktop GitHub app</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Capture your learning in a repository.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many tutorial sites to help you learn new skills.  As an example look at <strong><a href=""https://www.frontendmentor.io"">Frontend Mentor.</a></strong>  This site is helpfully setup to capture your work for each challenge in a GitHub repository.  While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional in utilizing the features of Git.    </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you begin a challenge, you should create a GitHub repository and do all of your work step by step capturing your work as you go.    </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you are ready to try that, go to the challenge page </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Create a new repository to house it.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Download the initial codebase provided, and push that to GitHub as your starting point.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Take the first step in the challenge, then test it, and finally push that work.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Test all the features you have done so far during the challenge.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>If you find a bug or perhaps a new feature or enhancement, stop and create an issue in the repository.   You don't have to fix it immediately, but it is very important to record the issue and steps to reproduce it.  </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Continue your work stepwise capturing each step by pushing it with a descriptive comment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Finally, or during the course of your work, look at the outstanding issues and pick one or two to address.  As each is fixed push the fix and close the issue. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to create a ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, update your resumé, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Create a project with other developers.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you learn with your friends take the opportunity to propose an original project that you all can work on together.   Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.   This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about it. </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resumé or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Software development freelancing...</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many locations around the globe that are hotspots for software development.   If you happen to live in one of those places, jobs can come looking for you.   But there are many places around the world that have little or no jobs in this field.  In those places you need some extra skills to get and keep work, but it can be done.  This site is a place to find help and to build community of fellow developers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Welcome</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My intention with this main page is to tell a story of a journey that you might be on.  I'll try to keep it pretty brief and include ""Learn more..."" links so you can dive deeper as you need.   Hopefully you will find yourself on this journey and find where you are in the story.  When you do, I invite you to contact me.  My intention is that I can help guide you along.   I hope that this will become a community of like minded people.  I invite you to help me understand your needs and together we will keep you moving.  No tricks or fees are involved.   See my <a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/about-michael/"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""22"">About page</a> for that background.  If you have questions or comments along the way please <a href=""mailto: MichaelKentBurns@gmail.com"">email me</a>.

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Developing your skills</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While traditional full time employment brings a degree of long term job security, freelancers need to keep their current skills fresh in order to stay relevant.  High tech work is constantly changing with new fields opening up almost daily.  Those new fields often have a higher demand for skilled individuals.  Being willing and able to add new skills will increase your chances to find work and will often pay much better.  </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Working as part of a team</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of the rapid pace of technology development and market requirements, most web and application development is done by integrated teams.  No one person can do it all themselves. It takes a team of specialists working individually and cross discipline to be successful. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A team can take on big jobs that a single person cannot do.   This presents opportunity for the individual developer.  Once you understand how a team can work together you can find the best place for you to contribute.   But while you are doing what you already know how to do, you will also learn something about the rest of the team and the roles they fill.   And you will find avenues to learn new skills while you build team skills.   </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Software development freelancing...</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many locations around the globe that are hotspots for software development.   If you happen to live in one of those places, jobs can come looking for you.   But there are many places around the world that have little or no jobs in this field.  In those places you need some extra skills to get and keep work, but it can be done.  This site is a place to find help and to build community of fellow developers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Learn a little about me and why I am developing this site on my <a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/about-michael/"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""22"">About page...</a></p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1 class=""wp-block-heading"">Welcome</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My intention with this main page is to tell a story of a journey that you might be on.  I'll try to keep it pretty brief and include ""Learn more..."" links so you can dive deeper as you need.   Hopefully you will find yourself on this journey and find where you are in the story.  When you do, I invite you to contact me.  My intention is that I can help guide you along.   I hope that this will become a community of like minded people.  I invite you to help me understand your needs and together we will keep you moving.  No tricks or fees are involved.   See my <a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/about-michael/"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""22"">About page</a> for that background.  If you have questions or comments along the way please <a href=""mailto: MichaelKentBurns@gmail.com"">email me</a>.

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Developing your skills</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While traditional full time employment brings a degree of long term job security, freelancers need to keep their current skills fresh in order to stay relevant.  High tech work is constantly changing with new fields opening up almost daily.  Those new fields often have a higher demand for skilled individuals.  Being willing and able to add new skills will increase your chances to find work and will often pay much better.  </p>

<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">Front end web</h4>

<p>The World Wide Web is a rapidly evolving place, and it is a challenging field to stay fresh in.   Sometimes there are dramatic shifts in interactive tech.</p>

<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">Working globally</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the advent of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software""><strong>open-source software</strong></a> there arose the need to have world wide access to the source code for the many projects.   <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git""><strong>Git</strong></a> is the source control tool invented for Linux development.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub""><strong>GitHub</strong></a> is a web interface for software development which uses Git for the source control features, and describes itself as collaborative version control.   It not only allows you to manage your own projects but lets you share them.  Furthermore it lets you explore a vast galaxy of other projects that you can learn from, and in some cases contribute to.  That is a great way of building your reputation. </p>

I can also get some feedback from you on what is helpful and what is not so much.  Eventually, I would like you to consider being more actively involved in making this site a place where you can help others and learn from them too. </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Finding work as an individual</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a number of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer"">freelance</a> marketplaces online.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/"">Upwork</a> is one we recommend.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Working as part of a team</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of the rapid pace of technology development and market requirements, most web and application development is done by integrated teams.  No one person can do it all themselves. It takes a team of specialists working individually and cross discipline to be successful. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A team can take on big jobs that a single person cannot do.   This presents opportunity for the individual developer.  Once you understand how a team can work together you can find the best place for you to contribute.   But while you are doing what you already know how to do, you will also learn something about the rest of the team and the roles they fill.   And you will find avenues to learn new skills while you build team skills.   </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Development platforms</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Doing web development work as an individual can be done with most any computer running Windows, Linux, or Macintosh.   You most likely already made a choice and are doing work.   However, as you move into full stack work, or start working as part of a team it will get more complex.   It is worth considering the options again. </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Working as part of a team</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of the rapid pace of technology development and market requirements, most web and application development is done by integrated teams.  No one person can do it all themselves. It takes a team of specialists working individually and cross discipline to be successful. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A team can take on big jobs that a single person cannot do.   This presents opportunity for the individual developer.  Once you understand how a team can work together you can find the best place for you to contribute.   But while you are doing what you already know how to do, you will also learn something about the rest of the team and the roles they fill.   And you will find avenues to learn new skills while you build team skills.   </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Working as part of a team</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of the rapid pace of technology development and market requirements, most web and application development is done by integrated teams.  No one person can do it all themselves. It takes a team of specialists working individually and cross discipline to be successful. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A team can take on big jobs that a single person cannot do.   This presents opportunity for the individual developer.  Once you understand how a team can work together you can find the best place to contribute.   But while you are doing what you already know how to do, you will also learn something about the rest of the team and the roles they fill.   And you will find avenues to learn new skills while you build team skills.   </p>

<p>Doing web development work as an individual can be done with most any computer running Windows, Linux, or Macintosh.   You most likely already made a choice and are doing work.   However, as you move into full stack work, or start working as part of a team it will get more complex.   It is worth considering the options again. </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"">HTML</a> is a rich markup language which can be viewed and coded in a simple text editing program.   It consists of the text to be presented interspersed with HTML markup tags that specify how that text should be displayed.   The filename usually ends in either .htm or .html to indicated that it can be displayed in a web browser.

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics.   While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale.   If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent.  Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish.   The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only.   A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives.   If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one.

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">JavaScript - A procedural programming language for web pages.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript"">JavaScript</a> is a programming language inspired by Java that is meant to run inside a web page.   All of the actual work is performed by the web browser itself. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As discussed above, all of the above technologies can run on any computer with a web browser.  The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer.   You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive.  Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class=""wp-block-code""><code>&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes, that is all that is needed.  However, that does not make any use of the internet or the World Wide Web.   The ""World Wide"" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=""http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm"">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.   The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol.  After that the ':' indicates the beginning of the location of the resource which usually starts with '//' followed by the name of the resource.   Try it yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific page (HelloWorld.htm).  A program called a web server running on that computer located the file for that page and other associated information and sent it back to your browser running on your computer.  Your browser then formatted it according to the HTML rules and you then see the results.   </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">GitHub</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the advent of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software""><strong>open-source software</strong></a> there arose the need to have world wide access to the source code for the many projects.   <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git""><strong>Git</strong></a> is the source control tool invented for Linux development, but it is now widely used on all platforms, operating systems, and languages.    I actually use Git to control the source of this entire WordPress site. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are command line versions of git for all major desktop systems.  One of the more popular graphical interfaces for git is <a href=""https://desktop.github.com""><strong>GitDesktop</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub""><strong>GitHub</strong></a> is a web interface for software development which uses Git for the source control features, and describes itself as collaborative version control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>GitHub</strong> supports the creation of personal accounts.  Each account can contain a number of repositories, which can be made public or private access.   A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer's personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.   As work progresses on the local machine and certain testable milestones are reached, the local changes can be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To get an idea of how this looks visit <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns"">my GitHub account.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.   Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all that in mind you should take action now by taking my <a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/challenge-setup-your-own-github-account-and-install-desktop-github-app/"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""187"">Challenge: Setup your own GitHub account and install Desktop GitHub app</a>.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Capture your learning in a repository.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many tutorial sites to help you learn new skills.  As an example look at <strong><a href=""https://www.frontendmentor.io"">Frontend Mentor.</a></strong>  It is a good practice to capture your work for each challenge in a GitHub repository.  While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional about utilizing the features of Git.    </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you begin a challenge, you should create a GitHub repository and do all of your work step by step capturing your work as you go.    </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you are ready to try that, go to<a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/challenge-capture-a-tutorial-project-in-a-github-repository/""> the challenge page</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to update the ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, update your resumé, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">GitHub</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the advent of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software""><strong>open-source software</strong></a> there arose the need to have world wide access to the source code for the many projects.   <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git""><strong>Git</strong></a> is the source control tool invented for Linux development, but it is now widely used on all platforms, operating systems, and languages.    I actually use Git to control the source of this entire WordPress site. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are command line versions of git for all major desktop systems.  One of the more popular graphical interfaces for git is <a href=""https://desktop.github.com""><strong>GitDesktop</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub""><strong>GitHub</strong></a> is a web interface for software development which uses Git for the source control features, and describes itself as collaborative version control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>GitHub</strong> supports the creation of personal accounts.  Each account can contain a number of repositories, which can be made public or private access.   A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer's personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.   As work progresses on the local machine and certain testable milestones are reached, the local changes can be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To get an idea of how this looks visit <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns"">my GitHub account.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.   Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all that in mind you should take action now by taking my <a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/challenge-setup-your-own-github-account-and-install-desktop-github-app/"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""187"">Challenge: Setup your own GitHub account and install Desktop GitHub app</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Capture your learning in a repository.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many tutorial sites to help you learn new skills.  As an example look at <strong><a href=""https://www.frontendmentor.io"">Frontend Mentor.</a></strong>  It is a good practice to capture your work for each challenge in a GitHub repository.  While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional about utilizing the features of Git.    </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you begin a challenge, you should create a GitHub repository and do all of your work step by step capturing your work as you go.    </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you are ready to try that, go to<a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/challenge-capture-a-tutorial-project-in-a-github-repository/""> the challenge page</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to update the ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, update your resumé, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Computer</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Internet access</li>

<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While those are the basics, you will likely also need:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Web hosting service</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Interactive Development Environment (IDE)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>Remote development shell</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Common platforms:</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'll not bother to describe all the many programs needed for each of these platforms since that will be found in the Development Tools page.   Rather, I'll discuss some of the unique attributes of each and how they relate.   You have probably already chosen a favorite platform, but may also be considering some alternatives.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Linux</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Almost all web hosting servers are running Linux so ultimately if you are going to do full stack development you will need to learn Linux.   Many developers have chosen to also use Linux as their local work computer.  We will discuss hosting servers a little later on this page, but for now we will consider Linux as a local development computer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Linux of course can be installed on PC's and Macintoshes.   It can be installed in a virtual machine on either of those platforms.   It also can run native on Windows using <a href=""https://cygwin.com"">Cygwin</a> which gives an existing Windows user the ability to use both Windows apps and Linux apps interchangeably.   That also eases the Linux learning curve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>MacOS is based on Unix and the Mac Terminal app depends on Unix (Linux) shells for line mode interactive commands.   There are many different shells available to choose from, but the most commonly used one in my experience is BASH.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you choose to run Linux as your native OS then you will almost always a graphical user interface.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Windows</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Windows you naturally have a graphical interface include Windows Explorer,  a web browser like Edge, an interactive command line tool like PowerShell or cmd.exe.   Using your browser there are applications galore that you can download and install.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition as mentioned above you can also install <a href=""https://cygwin.com"">Cygwin</a> and get lots of Linux goodies as well.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Macintosh</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As mentioned above MacOS is really UNIX under the covers.   The Terminal window runs many different UNIX shells.   Many common development tools are available for download and install and ready for use.     </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, since Terminal gets you into the core of UNIX there are many UNIX, and Linux package managers available that will let you install just like you are in Linux.  Homebrew is one option.   Just Google '<a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/?hps=1&amp;q=package+managers+for+mac&amp;ia=web"">package managers for mac</a>'</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Web hosting servers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most servers are virtual machines in a cloud server farms.   These are almost always headless meaning there is no display and keyboard.   You must access  these using some form of secure shell.   Checkout a google of '<a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ssh&amp;t=osx&amp;ia=web"">ssh</a>'.   ssh and many programs that use it require secure certificates to be generated and installed on your local machine.  I will have a whole 'How to' page dedicated to secure networking. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">How about you? </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Give all of those options you probably already have a development platform of some sort and it's now time to talk about it.     I need to know about your setup, your needs, and your questions.    I have a '<a href=""https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/challenge-tell-me-about-your-development-setup/"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""184"">Tell me about your development setup</a>' challenge page that you can use to tell me all about it.   So, go there and tell me.   </p>

<p>Because of the rapid pace of technology development and market requirements, most web and application development is done by integrated teams.  No one person can do it all themselves. It takes a team of specialists working individually and cross discipline to be successful. </p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Some of the roles that are needed are:</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Project lead</strong> - responsible for planning how the individuals in the team can work together to complete the project.   This is usually done in cooperation with the whole team to come to consensus on next steps and how to keep the project moving.</li>

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Database designer</strong> - much of the interface between the different parts of the solution are stored in a database.   This person designs the specific tables, columns, and indexes needed to ensure proper communication and integrity.</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Lead coder</strong> - this coder is the lead and will establish and enforce coding standards and facilitate code reviews.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Coder</strong> - an individual contributor that writes one or more specific code components. They may be front end, back end, or full stack coders depending on the languages they are proficient in. They will also design and write functional tests that ensure proper operation. These tests are often referred to as <strong>unit tests</strong> because they test the function of a specific code module.    </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Tester</strong> - a person responsible for designing an implementing test suites that ensure that the individual code components operate together.   This person will often work with the individual coders to ensure their unit tests are properly written.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Documenter</strong> - works with the individual team members to understand how their contributions work and writes functional internal documentation and/or end user documentation.  The documentation may be in the form of a user manual but will also likely have on screen components such as roll-over tool tips or info links like ⓘ.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Source controller</strong> - ensures that all of the artifacts of the team members are properly kept in a repository and that all changes to those artifacts are also captured in the repository.  </li>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best way to build your skills as a team player and move up to more responsible positions is to find a role that you can already fill and join a team.   With a little effort you will be able to learn more about the other team members and their roles as well as learn more about the larger project.   As you develop your skills you can build a reputation of trust.   Open source software projects are a great opportunity because they depend on volunteer contributions.  But, it should be noted that all work done for open software projects is not done for free.  The companies or organizations that rely on open source software often have specific needs that are not necessarily shared by the community at large.   These organizations will often pay their employees, or outside developers, to work on their special needs.  A close friend of mine does exactly this at SAS where I retired from. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many open source projects are dependent on other open source projects.  Working on one can give you valuable skills and understanding that can be a gateway to other projects.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, you can build relationships with other developers and learn of other opportunities.  </p>

<p>Running a hosted WordPress site on a cloud service is made possible by a number of services.   I use Cloudways, but there are others such as WPEngine.   In order to do development in those environments a developer needs to know Linux, shell, and remote headless environments including secure shell access.   The software that must be installed on a remote server is frequently referred to as LAMP, which stands for <strong>L</strong>inux Apache MySQL, PHP.    Typically, LAMP is installed as a series of servers which much be installed and configured on a Linux machine.  That is a fairly complex setup beyond the beginner Web developer. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is also a Macintosh equivalent called <strong>M</strong>AMP where <strong>M</strong> stands for Macintosh rather than Linux.   MAMP is neatly packaged up as a single downloadable application.   When you run the MAMP application it presents a simple control panel that allows you to start, stop, and monitor all of the various servers that are built into the application.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, for developers without those skills there are also several open source solutions that allow you to run a full stack environment on a Mac, Linux, or Windows personal computer.   One that I choose is called XAMPP.   The '<strong>X</strong>'  means that it will run on Linux, Windows, or Macintosh.      The one great simplification is that it is all packaged up as a single application like MAMP is. </p>

<p>Running a hosted WordPress site on a cloud service is made possible by a number of services.   I use Cloudways, but there are others such as WPEngine.   In order to do development in those environments a developer needs to know Linux, shell, and remote headless environments including secure shell access.   The software that must be installed on a remote server is frequently referred to as LAMP, which stands for <strong>L</strong>inux Apache MySQL, PHP.    Typically, LAMP is installed as a series of servers which much be installed and configured on a Linux machine.  That is a fairly complex setup beyond the beginner Web developer. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is also a Macintosh equivalent called <strong>M</strong>AMP where <strong>M</strong> stands for Macintosh rather than Linux.   MAMP is neatly packaged up as a single downloadable application.   When you run the MAMP application it presents a simple control panel that allows you to start, stop, and monitor all of the various servers that are built into the application.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, for developers without those skills there are also several open source solutions that allow you to run a full stack environment on a Mac, Linux, or Windows personal computer.   One that I choose is called XAMPP.   The '<strong>X</strong>'  means that it will run on Linux, Windows, or Macintosh.      The one great simplification is that it is all packaged up as a single application like MAMP is. </p>
