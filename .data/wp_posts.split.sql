While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale. If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent. Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish. The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only. A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives. If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one. A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database.

It involves working with databases, servers, application logic, and APIs to ensure that the front-end, or client-side, can communicate effectively with the server and perform tasks such as data retrieval, storage, and processing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"justify\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">While the front end is mostly concerned with the actual presentation of web information, there is much that the web browser cannot do. One thing certainly is multitasking. It is rare that a single person, using their browser to view a web page, is the only user at that specific site. The back end is run on a more powerful machine that can server up web pages to many users around the world at the same time. This concept is described in detail in the Wikipedia <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend\">Frontend and backend</a> page.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"justify\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">To make the back end work there are actually a number of servers running together that enable many web users to share access to a website.

As work progresses on the local machine and certain testable milestones are reached, the local changes can be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To get an idea of how this looks visit <a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns\">my GitHub account.</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.   Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Capture your learning in a repository.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many tutorial sites to help you learn new skills.  As an example look at <strong><a href=\"https://www.frontendmentor.io\">Frontend Mentor.</a></strong>  This site is helpfully setup to capture your work for each challenge in a GitHub repository.  While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional in utilizing the features of Git.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you begin a challenge, you should </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Create a new repository to house it.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Download the initial codebase provided, and push that to GitHub as your starting point.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Take the first step in the challenge, then test it, and finally push that work.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Test all the features you have done so far during the challenge.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>If you find a bug or perhaps a new feature or enhancement, stop and create an issue in the repository.   You don\'t have to fix it immediately, but it is very important to record the issue and steps to reproduce it.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Continue your work stepwise capturing each step by pushing it with a descriptive comment.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Finally, or during the course of your work, look at the outstanding issues and pick one or two to address.  As each is fixed push the fix and close the issue. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to create a ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, update your resum√©, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create a project with other developers.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you learn with your friends take the opportunity to propose an original project that you all can work on together.   Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.   This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about. </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resum√© or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Work globally...','','inherit','closed','closed','','59-revision-v1','','','2023-04-03 21:31:38','2023-04-03 21:31:38','',59,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=75',0,'revision','',0),

You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resum√© or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Work globally...','','inherit','closed','closed','','59-revision-v1','','','2024-02-09 23:07:35','2024-02-09 23:07:35','',59,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=148',0,'revision','',0),

You don\'t have to fix it immediately, but it is very important to record the issue and steps to reproduce it.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Continue your work stepwise capturing each step by pushing it with a descriptive comment.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Finally, or during the course of your work, look at the outstanding issues and pick one or two to address.  As each is fixed push the fix and close the issue. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to create a ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, update your resum√©, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create a project with other developers.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you learn with your friends take the opportunity to propose an original project that you all can work on together.   Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.   This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about it. </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resum√© or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Work globally','','inherit','closed','closed','','59-revision-v1','','','2024-02-10 23:38:34','2024-02-10 23:38:34','',59,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=164',0,'revision','',0),

Each account can contain a number of repositories, which can be made public or private access.   A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer\'s personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.   As work progresses on the local machine and certain testable milestones are reached, the local changes can be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To get an idea of how this looks visit <a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns\">my GitHub account.</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.   Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/?page_id=59\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"59\">Learn more...</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Building your brand</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/building-your-brand/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"76\">Learn more...</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding work</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are a number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer\">freelance</a> marketplaces online.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/\">Upwork</a> is one we recommend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/finding-work/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"79\">Learn more...</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Latest Posts</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:latest-posts {\"align\":\"center\"} /-->','Home','','inherit','closed','closed','','2-revision-v1','','','2024-02-15 17:58:55','2024-02-15 17:58:55','',2,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=174',0,'revision','',0),

But, you don\'t want to do your work there, in fact you can\'t.  Instead the idea is that you create a copy of that repository locally on your own machine and develop in that copy.     There are two ways to upload your progress at each step on the way.  One is the original \'git\' cli command.   That requires a little learning which is not a bad idea.  But there is a companion Desktop app that looks a lot like the GitHub.com site.  It is called <a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\">GitHub Desktop</a>.  You can download that from this link now and install it.  Alternatively, once you have created your first repository and want to \'clone\' it to your desktop machine, the cloning process will offer to install the desktop app for you and feed it the command to do the copy of your new repository.   </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>To get a feel for how this works, take the time to create a \'my first repo\' repository and clone it to your desktop machine.

To do that when looking at the repository in GitHub.com, you will see a number of tabs along the top:  \'&lt;&gt; Code\', \'Issues\', ... \'Settings\'.   Pick the Settings.   It will automatically fill in the repository name, and the Default branch will probably be set to \'main\'.    On the left side of the screen in the sidebar, under \'Code and automation\' there is an item named \'Pages\'.  Pick that.   Once there it\'s pretty easy.  Under \'Source\' there is a selector to pick the branch.   That should already say \'Deploy from a branch\'.   Leave that as it is.  Below that is a section labeled \'Branch\'.  In there are two buttons that should say \'None\' and \'Save\'.  It is not real obvious but click the \'None\' button and select the \'main\' branch\'.  Finally press the \'Save\' button.

A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer\'s personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.

Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With all that in mind you should take action now by taking my <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/challenge-setup-your-own-github-account-and-install-desktop-github-app/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"187\">Challenge: Setup your own GitHub account and install Desktop GitHub app</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Capture your learning in a repository.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many tutorial sites to help you learn new skills.  As an example look at <strong><a href=\"https://www.frontendmentor.io\">Frontend Mentor.</a></strong>  This site is helpfully setup to capture your work for each challenge in a GitHub repository.  While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional in utilizing the features of Git.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you begin a challenge, you should create a GitHub repository and do all of your work step by step capturing your work as you go.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are ready to try that, go to the challenge page </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Create a new repository to house it.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Download the initial codebase provided, and push that to GitHub as your starting point.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Take the first step in the challenge, then test it, and finally push that work.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Test all the features you have done so far during the challenge.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>If you find a bug or perhaps a new feature or enhancement, stop and create an issue in the repository.   You don\'t have to fix it immediately, but it is very important to record the issue and steps to reproduce it.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Continue your work stepwise capturing each step by pushing it with a descriptive comment.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Finally, or during the course of your work, look at the outstanding issues and pick one or two to address.  As each is fixed push the fix and close the issue. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to create a ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, update your resum√©, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create a project with other developers.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you learn with your friends take the opportunity to propose an original project that you all can work on together.   Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.   This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about it. </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resum√© or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Work globally','','inherit','closed','closed','','59-revision-v1','','','2024-02-15 22:07:48','2024-02-15 22:07:48','',59,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=197',0,'revision','',0),

It consists of the text to be presented interspersed with HTML markup tags that specify how that text should be displayed.   The filename usually ends in either .htm or .html to indicated that it can be displayed in a web browser.  The HTML markup standards have been around since the beginning of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web\">World Wide Web.</a>  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTML5</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5\">HTML5</a> is simply the 5th major revision of the HTML standards that added significant modern features that make some web pages very dynamic. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS\">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics.   While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale.   If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent.  Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish.   The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only.   A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives.   If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one.    A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database.  But, that is another subject for another day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript - A procedural programming language for web pages.</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript\">JavaScript</a> is a programming language inspired by Java that is meant to run inside a web page.   All of the actual work is performed by the web browser itself. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As discussed above, all of the above technologies can run on any computer with a web browser.  The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer.   You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive.  Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then using your file browser (Windows explorer or Mac Finder) to locate that file and open it as you would any other document. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, that is all that is needed.  However, that does not make any use of the internet or the World Wide Web.   The \"World Wide\" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=\"http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm\">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.   The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol.

Try it yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific page (HelloWorld.htm).

It consists of the text to be presented interspersed with HTML markup tags that specify how that text should be displayed.   The filename usually ends in either .htm or .html to indicated that it can be displayed in a web browser.  The HTML markup standards have been around since the beginning of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web\">World Wide Web.</a>  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTML5</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5\">HTML5</a> is simply the 5th major revision of the HTML standards that added significant modern features that make some web pages very dynamic. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS\">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics.   While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale.   If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent.  Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish.   The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only.   A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives.   If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one.    A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database.  But, that is another subject for another day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript - A procedural programming language for web pages.</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript\">JavaScript</a> is a programming language inspired by Java that is meant to run inside a web page.   All of the actual work is performed by the web browser itself. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As discussed above, all of the above technologies can run on any computer with a web browser.  The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer.   You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive.  Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then using your file browser (Windows explorer or Mac Finder) to locate that file and open it as you would any other document. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, that is all that is needed.  However, that does not make any use of the internet or the World Wide Web.   The \"World Wide\" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=\"http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm\">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.   The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol.  After that the \':\' indicates the beginning of the location of the resource which usually starts with \'//\' followed by the name of the resource.   Try it yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific page (HelloWorld.htm).  A web server program running on that computer located the file for that page and other associated information and sent it back to your browser running on your computer.  Your browser then formatted it according to the HTML rules and you then see the results.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The details of that is for the next page (<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/back-end-web/\">Back end web</a>).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Front end web','','inherit','closed','closed','','49-revision-v1','','','2024-02-16 16:51:24','2024-02-16 16:51:24','',49,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=220',0,'revision','',0),

For the description use the title of this page: \'<strong>Challenge: capture a tutorial project in a GitHub repository</strong>\'.    Leave the default setting for <strong>Public</strong> rather than <strong>Private</strong>.  Check the box to \'Add a README file.\'  Do not bother adding a .gitignore file.   For \'Choose a license\', leave it \'None\'.    Finally, click \'<strong>Create repository</strong>\'.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>:  Learn how to edit your new README.md file.  You will notice that the list of files in your repository consists of the single file \'README.md\'.   Below that will be a text area labeled \'<strong>README</strong>\', and it should already include the name of your repository and the description text.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>:  Near the top of the page, under the GitHub icon and your name, you will notice a line of tab labels.   The first one is \'<strong>Code</strong>\' and that one will be selected automatically.   After that is \'<strong>Issues</strong>\'.   Click on that.  It won\'t look very interesting at first because you have not created any issues.  You should see a green button labeled \'<strong>New issue</strong>\'.  Click on that and you should see a page that lets you add a title and description for your new issue.  In the area for your description, you will notice two tabs labeled \'<strong>Write</strong>\' and \'<strong>Preview</strong>\' with \'<strong>Write</strong>\' being selected.  Under that is a text area.   We will cover the features of this text area which are fairly extensive.  But, for now just enter simple text.   Type \'This repository needs a good README.md file\' into the Title field and the description area.  Then press the green \'Submit new issue\' button.  After that, you should see a more interesting issue page with a completed comment containing the description you just typed.     Below that will be another text area where you can enter another comment.   An issue is a list of comments that you and your mentor will write.  It\'s like a chat session about this issue.    Finally notice to the right of the first comment a label \'Assignees\' with a value of \'No one-\' and a link that will assign yourself as the person assigned to fix this issue.  Do that now.   Notice the changes to the page when you do that.  You should see your name and picture appear in multiple places.   Now that you have your first issue, you have assigned yourself the task of starting the README.md file.    Finish this page by clicking on the \'<strong>Code</strong>\' tab a the top of the page.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong>.   Invite your mentor to join you on this repository.  At the very top of the page, you will see your repository title.  Right click on that and in the drop down menu select \'share...\'.   You will see a familiar dialog allowing you to share this repository via email, or other means.   Select email and address the message to your mentor.   Address your email to your mentor and \'cc\' me: MichaelKentBurns@gmail.com.   Enter an appropriate subject line, such as the title of your repository.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Step 5. Once your mentor has accepted your invitation you can begin working.  First, you should edit your README.md file to describe the web development challenge you have chosen.   While you can type just simple text into this file, the file extension of .md indicates that this file can contain Markdown, which is a lot more than simple text.  You don\'t need to learn all about Markdown, but a simple tutorial page is this one from w3schools.io:  <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.io/file/markdown-introduction/\">Markdown Tutorials</a>.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using markdown syntax you can indicate where your challenge comes from and why you chose that one.  Make sure you include a link to the source of the challenge.   You and your mentor can discuss what you hope to learn from this challenge.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many things that are appropriate for a Github repository README.md file, but that will come later.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Start reading the instructions for your challenge.  It should guide you through the process of setting up your project.   Before you start the actual work, you need to use Github Desktop or one of the other similar programs.  You can also choose one of the web development IDE programs that include GitHub support.    VS Code is a popular choice.   Using those tools, create a local clone of your repository so you have a working copy on your machine that you can edit, debug, and test the code you develop.     Usually in challenges, the first step is to download a set of files that form the starting material.   Go ahead and do that, but don\'t actually start working yet.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 6</strong>.  Using the tools in your IDE or other Git desktop program, commit the starting materials with an explanation code of \'download starting materials\'.  Then push that to GitHub.   This allows your mentor and anyone else to see your starting point.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 7</strong>. From this point forward, you should work in small increments.  Read the instructions for a small amount of work, then <strong>create a new Issue</strong> in GitHub describing the requirements of that step and how you propose to implement it.  At first you should take some time to think through what you are going to do and describe the changes you need to accomplish it.  Assign that issue to yourself, but also include your mentor so that he is notified when you make new notes and especially when you commit and push changes. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> Use your tools, and reference to tutorial materials to implement the change you need to implement what is described in your new issue.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 9.</strong>  Test and debug your new changes.  If a test is more than trivial like just looking at your page in your web browser, you should write a test description.  I suggest creating a \'test\' directory inside your project, then create a text file to describe the step by step process of setting up and executing the test.    This may seem too trivial but it is a very important step and will become much more important as your work progresses.   Specifically, name the test file descriptively so that someone else can know what issue you were working on and what specifically you are testing.  Your mentor is likely to want to use your test file to exercise your code when you push your changes for this issue.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 10.</strong> When you are confident you have addressed that issue, go ahead and commit and push.  Make sure your commit message clearly indicates the issue being addressed.  You will see later why that is important.    When you do the push, you should also add a note to the issue so your mentor knows that you pushed a significant change that he should review.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 11.</strong>  Review your work.   When your mentor is notified of your update to the issue, he will be able to go to the GitHub project and see your commit.   If you have not learned this yet, let me take a moment to describe it.    With every commit, not only are the changes to the files pushed to GitHub, but in the Code tab, at the top of the list of files you will see an indication of the latest commit.  It will give the name of the person, the explanation of the commit, and usually a link to the issue that is being addressed.   Too the right of that, you should see the date of the commit.  Finally, if there is enough room on the page, it should tell you how many total commits there have been.  If you don\'t see that, then grow the page or shrink the text until it appears.    If you click on that, you will see a complete list of all commits.  Take a look at one now, either in your project or any other GitHub project.   Each item in that list is a link that will show you a list of all the files changed and an annotated portion of the source that was changed.   Lines that were removed are highlighted in red with a \'-\' minus sign in the left margin.  Lines added are highlighted in green with a \'+\'.  Finally, notice at the bottom of the commit page there is another text box for you or more likely your mentor to comment on the changes you made.   This can start a discussion where your mentor points out something you could have done different, or asks a question about why you made the change you did.   This will be a very fruitful discussion, and you will learn a lot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have done as I suggested and written a test case file, that should be included in the commit and the source will now be in the repository.  Your mentor is likely to inspect that file and run your test.  He may notice other problems, or perhaps pointed out good aspects of the way you made your change.    This discussion is called a \'<strong>Code Review</strong>\'.  We will talk about those in a future lesson.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is possible that your mentor may suggest yet another change either as an additional note in the Issue you were working on, or possibly he will have created another issue.    If it is another issue, then you may be able to proceed with your work as planned, knowing that you have a new issue that can be addressed later in your process.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 12. </strong> If the code review was successful and your work was approved you should add one final note to the Issue page and rather than pressing the green Comment button, you can press the other button labeled \'Close with comment\'.  That indicates that the issue is resolved.   At this point, you can go back to Step 7 where you choose another small unit of work and create a new issue to discuss and resolve that work.  This process continues until the whole project is complete.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 13.</strong>  Finish your project.   But, finishing requires one more step and that is to cleanup and complete your README.md file.    First, read this article from FreeCodeCamp about \'<strong><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/\">How to Write a good README File for Your GitHub Project.</a></strong>\'   It is especially important to do this step well.   You will also want to put a link to your GitHub repository in your Upwork profile.   It is important that clients considering you for a job be able to not just see a list of what you think you know, but to see an actual project that demonstrates your knowledge and skill.   Having followed all the instructions in this challenge will ensure that a client can read your repository and see how you work.   You will be demonstrating not only your skill in coding but also your professional discipline and teamwork.    Make sure the README.md file is a good overall summary of your project.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 14.</strong> There will soon be a survey to complete showing that you have completed this challenge.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Challenge: capture a tutorial project in a GitHub repository','','publish','closed','closed','','challenge-capture-a-tutorial-project-in-a-github-repository','','','2024-07-20 21:34:36','2024-07-20 21:34:36','',0,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?page_id=222',0,'page','',0),

It can be installed in a virtual machine on either of those platforms.   It also can run native on Windows using <a href=\"https://cygwin.com\">Cygwin</a> which gives an existing Windows user the ability to use both Windows apps and Linux apps interchangeably.   That also eases the Linux learning curve.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>MacOS is based on Unix and the Mac Terminal app depends on Unix (Linux) shells for line mode interactive commands.

The software that must be installed on a remote server is frequently referred to as LAMP, which stands for <strong>L</strong>inux Apache MySQL, PHP.

That is a fairly complex setup beyond the beginner Web developer. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is also a Macintosh equivalent called <strong>M</strong>AMP where <strong>M</strong> stands for Macintosh rather than Linux.   MAMP is neatly packaged up as a single downloadable application.   When you run the MAMP application it presents a simple control panel that allows you to start, stop, and monitor all of the various servers that are built into the application.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, for developers without those skills there are also several open source solutions that allow you to run a full stack environment on a Mac, Linux, or Windows personal computer.   One that I choose is called XAMPP.   The \'<strong>X</strong>\'  means that it will run on Linux, Windows, or Macintosh.      The one great simplification is that it is all packaged up as a single application like MAMP is. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:group {\"layout\":{\"type\":\"flex\",\"flexWrap\":\"nowrap\"}} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html\">XAMPP</a> is available from an open source software group named <a href=\"https://www.apachefriends.org\">Apache Friends</a>.

A WordPress site is no exception. However, a WordPress site is significantly different than normal software projects in several regards:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>There is a lot of WordPress itself, as well as its Themes and Plugins that are contained in the public_html directory.

For one, it is a good way to detect corruption in a site.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>The vast majority of the content of a WP site is in posts and pages. When an author writes a blog post or a page of any sort, it does not create any new web pages in public_html. This is a result of the fact that WP contains a powerful CMS (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\">ContentManagementSystem</a>). A CMS manages the content in a database not a directory full of fully rendered HTML pages. This is discussed more in the <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/full-stack/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"55\">Full stack</a> page. The actual content of a blog post or a page is stored as a separate record in the wp_posts table. Blog posts have a post_type of \'post\' and pages (like this one) have a post_type of \'page\'. There are in fact a number of other things that get stored in the wp_posts table. As a result of these items stored as records in a table, doing the GitHub tracking of the text of a file will not show changes in individual posts or pages.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dumping the SQL data for source control</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><p>Because the main visible content is stored in a database table it is necessary to extract the individual records of the wp_posts (and other tables) to textual form so the normal GitHub mechanisms can show it in a readable form. As a first step to doing that, I have written a shells script called \'<strong>dumpall</strong>\' that is kept in the public_html directory (for now). That script is run in a shell process on the WP host site before a Git commit and push commands are run to update the GitHub repository. This is step 1 in the GitHub issue #10 of the GitHub repository\'. Later, I will write a program to extract each record of the wp_posts table into a separate text file in a .data/posts directory. It will require some nicer format than a simple SQL dump.</p><br><p>One issue with the <strong>dumpall¬†</strong>script is that the SQL dump for a specific table creates an INSERT statement to create all records into the table, but all of those records are written to a single line. ¬†Thus when GitHub tries to show the differences between subsequent revisions of a file, it looks like one VERY long line with lots of differences. ¬† What I would rather have is an INSERT statement that puts each record on a separate line. ¬† I have written a shell alias that uses the sed command to split that INSERT line into many lines. ¬† Thus, in the .data directory of my GitHub repository you will see the original SQL dump in a file named <strong>wp_posts.sql</strong> and a version with the lines split named <strong>wp_posts.split.sql</strong>. ¬†I am pushing this change on Wednesday April 17th, 2024 so you should see the text of this post will be changed in the <strong>wp_posts.split.sql</strong> file.</p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dumping the markup for all pages and posts </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition to saving the SQL tables generally, I want to export the text of all the Pages and Posts as separate files.   This allows GitHub change tracking to present the textual changes to the posts and pages individually.    To do this I wrote two shell scripts named <strong>dumpPages</strong> and <strong>dumpPosts</strong>.   dumpPages uses the wp command line utility to get each page markup text into a file in the .pages directory.  The file is named <strong>page-&lt;name-of-page&gt;.wpmu</strong> . The .wpmu extension is my extension name for \"Word Press mark up\".    For example <strong>.pages/how-to-use-github-to-source-control-a-wordpress-site.wpmu</strong> contains the markup text of this page.   The dumpPosts command does the same for posts and stores them in the .posts directory. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When these commands are executed in a secure terminal connected to the server running this WordPress site,  then the markup is exposed as text files to the git program.

One thing certainly is multitasking.  It is rare that a single person, using their browser to view a web page, is the only user at that specific site.  The back end is run on a more powerful machine that can server up web pages to many users around the world at the same time.

But, you don\'t want to do your work there, in fact you can\'t.  Instead the idea is that you create a copy of that repository locally on your own machine and develop in that copy.     There are two ways to upload your progress at each step on the way.  One is the original \'git\' cli command.   That requires a little learning which is not a bad idea.  But there is a companion Desktop app that looks a lot like the GitHub.com site.  It is called <a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\">GitHub Desktop</a>.  You can download that from this link now and install it.  Alternatively, once you have created your first repository and want to \'clone\' it to your desktop machine, the cloning process will offer to install the desktop app for you and feed it the command to do the copy of your new repository.   </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>To get a feel for how this works, take the time to create a \'my first repo\' repository and clone it to your desktop machine.   Then code a simple \'HelloWorld.html\' page.  If you are not familiar with \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program\">Hello, World!</a>\" checkout the wikipedia page.  There you will find source for this simple starter app in almost any language known, including HTML.   When you have coded it, then use the desktop app to commit that and push it to your public repository.   </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Once you have it working locally and have pushed it to the GitHub site you can actually create a \'GitHub Page\' to publish the working page for the whole world to see.   To do that when looking at the repository in GitHub.com, you will see a number of tabs along the top:  \'&lt;&gt; Code\', \'Issues\', ... \'Settings\'.   Pick the Settings.   It will automatically fill in the repository name, and the Default branch will probably be set to \'main\'.    On the left side of the screen in the sidebar, under \'Code and automation\' there is an item named \'Pages\'.  Pick that.   Once there it\'s pretty easy.  Under \'Source\' there is a selector to pick the branch.   That should already say \'Deploy from a branch\'.   Leave that as it is.  Below that is a section labeled \'Branch\'.  In there are two buttons that should say \'None\' and \'Save\'.  It is not real obvious but click the \'None\' button and select the \'main\' branch\'.  Finally press the \'Save\' button.   It should then tell you \'Your GitHub Pages site is currently being built from the&nbsp;<code>main</code>&nbsp;branch.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/\">Learn more about configuring the publishing source for your site</a>.\'  In a few moments you can refresh that page and see a note near the top that says something like \'Your site is live at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.github.io/Hello-World/\">https://michaelkentburns.github.io/Hello-World/</a>Last&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/Hello-World/actions/runs/7922504847\">deployed</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<img width=\"14\" height=\"14\" src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5041124?s=28&amp;v=4\" alt=\"@MichaelKentBurns\"><a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns\">MichaelKentBurns</a>&nbsp;1 minute ago\'.   Just click that link or the \'Visit site\' button. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Now that it is published live, you can make a small change to your local copy of the program and commit and push that to GitHub and within a short time your change will be live.

Rather, I\'ll discuss some of the unique attributes of each and how they relate.   You have probably already chosen a favorite platform, but may also be considering some alternatives.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Linux</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Almost all web hosting servers are running Linux so ultimately if you are going to do full stack development you will need to learn Linux.   Many developers have chosen to also use Linux as their local work computer.  We will discuss hosting servers a little later on this page, but for now we will consider Linux as a local development computer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Linux of course can be installed on PC\'s and Macintoshes.   It can be installed in a virtual machine on either of those platforms.   It also can run native on Windows using <a href=\"https://cygwin.com\">Cygwin</a> which gives an existing Windows user the ability to use both Windows apps and Linux apps interchangeably.   That also eases the Linux learning curve.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>MacOS is based on Unix and the Mac Terminal app depends on Unix (Linux) shells for line mode interactive commands.   There are many different shells available to choose from, but the most commonly used one in my experience is BASH.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you choose to run Linux as your native OS then you will almost always use a graphical user interface.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Windows</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With Windows you naturally have a graphical interface including Windows Explorer,  a web browser like InternetExplorer or Edge, an interactive command line tool like PowerShell or cmd.exe.   Using your browser there are applications galore that you can download and install.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition as mentioned above you can also install <a href=\"https://cygwin.com\">Cygwin</a> and get lots of Linux goodies as well.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Macintosh</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As mentioned above MacOS is really UNIX under the covers.   The Terminal window runs many different UNIX shells.   Many common development tools are available for download and install and ready for use.     </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, since Terminal gets you into the core of UNIX there are many UNIX, and Linux package managers available that will let you install just like you are in Linux.  Homebrew is one option.   Just Google \'<a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?hps=1&amp;q=package+managers+for+mac&amp;ia=web\">package managers for mac</a>\'</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Web hosting servers</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most servers are virtual machines in a cloud server farms.   These are almost always headless meaning there is no display and keyboard.   You must access  these using some form of secure shell.   Checkout a google of \'<a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ssh&amp;t=osx&amp;ia=web\">ssh</a>\'.   ssh and many programs that use it require secure certificates to be generated and installed on your local machine.  I will have a whole \'How to\' page dedicated to secure networking. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How about you? </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Give all of those options you probably already have a development platform of some sort and it\'s now time to talk about it.

It consists of the text to be presented interspersed with HTML markup tags that specify how that text should be displayed.   The filename usually ends in either .htm or .html to indicated that it can be displayed in a web browser.  The HTML markup standards have been around since the beginning of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web\">World Wide Web.</a>  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTML5</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5\">HTML5</a> is simply the 5th major revision of the HTML standards that added significant modern features that make some web pages very dynamic. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS\">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics.   While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale.   If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent.  Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish.   The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only.   A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives.   If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one.    A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database.  But, that is another subject for another day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript - A procedural programming language for web pages.</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript\">JavaScript</a> is a programming language inspired by Java that is meant to run inside a web page.   All of the actual work is performed by the web browser itself. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As discussed above, all of the above technologies can run on any computer with a web browser.  The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer.   You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive.  Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then using your file browser (Windows explorer or Mac Finder) to locate that file and open it as you would any other document. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, that is all that is needed.  However, that does not make any use of the internet or the World Wide Web.   The \"World Wide\" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=\"http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm\">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.  The formal name for this address is a URL.  See the wikipedia page <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL\">A&nbsp;<strong>uniform resource locator</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>URL</strong>)</a> for details.  The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol which is one of several protocols as explained in the URL page.  After that the \':\' indicates the beginning of the location of the resource which usually starts with \'//\' followed by the name of the resource.   Try it yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific page (HelloWorld.htm).  A web server program running on that computer located the file for that page and other associated information and sent it back to your browser running on your computer.  Your browser then formatted it according to the HTML rules and you then see the results.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If, however, you have saved a web page on your local hard drive you would access it using the \'file\' protocol with an address something like this: \"<a>file://C:/Michael/HelloWorld.htm</a>\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The details of that is for the next page (<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/back-end-web/\">Back end web</a>).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Before you move on, remember this roadmap to your career</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A friend of mine who is a reader of this site has contributed a <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/about-michael/contributors/philemons-contributions/your-front-end-development-journey-a-step-by-step-roadmap/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"299\">roadmap to a Front-End development journey</a>.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Front end web','','inherit','closed','closed','','49-revision-v1','','','2024-03-30 17:56:32','2024-03-30 17:56:32','',49,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=308',0,'revision','',0),

A WordPress site is no exception. However, a WordPress site is significantly different than normal software projects in several regards:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>There is a lot of WordPress itself, as well as its Themes and Plugins that are contained in the public_html directory. That is OK, and it\'s worthwhile tracking changes to those files. For one, it is a good way to detect corruption in a site.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>The vast majority of the content of a WP site is in posts and pages. When an author writes a blog post or a page of any sort, it does not create any new web pages in public_html. This is a result of the fact that WP contains a powerful CMS (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\">ContentManagementSystem</a>). A CMS manages the content in a database not a directory full of fully rendered HTML pages. This is discussed more in the <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/full-stack/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"55\">Full stack</a> page. The actual content of a blog post or a page is stored as a separate record in the wp_posts table. Blog posts have a post_type of \'post\' and pages (like this one) have a post_type of \'page\'. There are in fact a number of other things that get stored in the wp_posts table. As a result of these items stored as records in a table, doing the GitHub tracking of the text of a file will not show changes in individual posts or pages.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Because the main visible content is stored in a database table it is necessary to extract the individual records of the wp_posts (and other tables) to textual form so the normal GitHub mechanisms can show it in a readable form. As a first step to doing that, I have written a shells script called \'<strong>dumpall</strong>\' that is kept in the public_html directory (for now). That script is run in a shell process on the WP host site before a Git commit and push commands are run to update the GitHub repository. This is step 1 in the GitHub issue #10 of the GitHub repository\'. Later, I will write a program to extract each record of the wp_posts table into a separate text file in a .data/posts directory. It will require some nicer format than a simple SQL dump.</p>\r\n<p>One issue with the <strong>dumpall¬†</strong>script is that the SQL dump for a specific table creates an INSERT statement to create all records into the table, but all of those records are written to a single line. ¬†Thus when GitHub tries to show the differences between subsequent revisions of a file, it looks like one VERY long line with lots of differences. ¬† What I would rather have is an INSERT statement that puts each record on a separate line. ¬† I have written a shell alias that uses the sed command to split that INSERT line into many lines. ¬† Thus, in the .data directory of my GitHub repository you will see the original SQL dump in a file named <strong>wp_posts.sql</strong> and a version with the lines split named <strong>wp_posts.split.sql</strong>. ¬†I am pushing this change on Wednesday April 17th, 2024 so you should see the text of this post will be changed in the <strong>wp_posts.split.sql</strong> file.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','How to use GitHub to source control a WordPress site','','inherit','closed','closed','','266-revision-v1','','','2024-04-17 22:44:02','2024-04-17 22:44:02','',266,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=322',0,'revision','',0),

The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer.   You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive.

However, that does not make any use of the internet or the World Wide Web.   The \"World Wide\" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=\"http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm\">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.  The formal name for this address is a URL.  See the wikipedia page <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL\">A&nbsp;<strong>uniform resource locator</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>URL</strong>)</a> for details.  The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol which is one of several protocols as explained in the URL page.  After that the \':\' indicates the beginning of the location of the resource which usually starts with \'//\' followed by the name of the resource.   Try it yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific page (HelloWorld.htm).  A web server program running on that computer located the file for that page and other associated information and sent it back to your browser running on your computer.  Your browser then formatted it according to the HTML rules and you then see the results.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If, however, you have saved a web page on your local hard drive you would access it using the \'file\' protocol with an address something like this: \"<a>file://C:/Michael/HelloWorld.htm</a>\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The details of that is for the next page (<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/back-end-web/\">Back end web</a>).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Want to see web development concepts come to life?

It consists of the text to be presented interspersed with HTML markup tags that specify how that text should be displayed. The filename usually ends in either .htm or .html to indicated that it can be displayed in a web browser.

The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer. You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive. Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then using your file browser (Windows explorer or Mac Finder) to locate that file and open it as you would any other document.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTML5</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5\">HTML5</a> is simply the 5th major revision of the HTML standards that added significant modern features that make some web pages very dynamic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>HTML5 is a significant evolution of HTML, introducing new features that enhance web development capabilities. Here are some key aspects:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Semantic Elements:</strong>&nbsp;HTML5 introduces semantic elements like&nbsp;<code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,&nbsp;<code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,&nbsp;<code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, etc., which provide more meaning to the content beyond just visual presentation. Search engines can better understand the structure of your webpage, aiding in searchability.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Multimedia Support:</strong>&nbsp;Gone are the days of relying solely on plugins like Flash. HTML5 offers built-in support for audio and video elements, allowing direct embedding of multimedia content within web pages.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Offline Capabilities:</strong>&nbsp;Web applications can leverage features like local storage and application cache to store data locally. This enables functionality even when the user is offline, improving user experience.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Improved Forms:</strong>&nbsp;HTML5 provides new input types like&nbsp;<code>email</code>,&nbsp;<code>url</code>,&nbsp;<code>date</code>, etc., simplifying user input validation and enhancing form functionality.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Canvas and SVG:</strong>&nbsp;Developers can create dynamic graphics, animations, and illustrations directly within web pages using the&nbsp;<code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>&nbsp;elements.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS\">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics. While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale. If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent. Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish. The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only. A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives. If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one. A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database.

While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale. If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent. Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish. The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only. A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives. If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one. A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database.

They wanted to spend only a little time on the estimate and then simply get to work.   As they worked they kept rough track of the time spent on each task they had estimated and after every week or two (called a sprint like in Rugby) they took a few minutes to reflect on the sprint and their estimates versus actuals.   The idea is to slowly get better and better at estimating the effort for small pieces of the work so they could more accurately plan and finish small to large parts of the overall project.   Each sprint they get better and learn more.  That makes the next sprint planning meeting much quicker and more accurate.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One particular team always had a bowl of gummy bears on the table when they had their planning meetings.  So everybody grabbed a handful and put them on the table in front of themselves.    As they considered each task they would each put a certain number of bears out in front (like poker) and then explained why they thought that task was easy or hard to do.   After everybody made their bid, the team came to a quick agreement and assigned a number (usually between 1 and 7 bears) to a task.  Then they moved on.  The whole meeting goes pretty quick and soon they have a set of tasks to do in the sprint and assign those to capable engineers.    Done. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why something silly? Well many teams got a little more formal and ended up calling them \"<a href=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/points-estimates-in/\"><strong>Story Points</strong></a>\". The main idea is that it is a concept that each team uses to judge relative difficulty based on what they are capable of . You DON\'T want to use some real unit of time (like hours or days or weeks). Because once you do that, you have driven a stake in the ground and committed yourself to actually getting it done on that schedule. This leads to short cuts, burn out, and slipped schedules.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, what does it really mean to the team?  That is up to the team.  They have their own way of relating the effort for a specific task based on what similar tasks have been in their past.   Also, what ends up happening is that since their knowledge of the tasks grows and they get quicker at understanding and finishing tasks, they find out that they are getting faster at getting the tasks done.  We call this \"team velocity\".   As they get better they can get more gummy bears or story points done in a single sprint.    This is a very rewarding and motivating way of planning.  It is empowering.   The alternative of setting hard deadlines and then missing them or getting done too early is very de-motivating.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Much more to come...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->','How To Do Easy Time Estimates','','publish','open','closed','','how-to-do-easy-time-estimates','','','2024-06-02 21:38:00','2024-06-02 21:38:00','',108,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?page_id=404',0,'page','',0),

His job is to hire a team that are qualified to do the job, guide them along the way, and get them the resources they need to do the job.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The team however, gets to determine how they will organize the work, plan the schedule, and get the job done.  They are day to day, week by week, coordinating and working together as best they can to get it done on time and to requirements.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gummy Bears</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gummy_bear\">Gummy Bears are a favorite snack of children and software engineers. </a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many of the early agile teams wanted a quick and easy way to make rough estimates of the work required and how best to organize the effort.  They wanted to spend only a little time on the estimate and then simply get to work.   As they worked they kept rough track of the time spent on each task they had estimated and after every week or two (called a sprint like in Rugby) they took a few minutes to reflect on the sprint and their estimates versus actuals.   The idea is to slowly get better and better at estimating the effort for small pieces of the work so they could more accurately plan and finish small to large parts of the overall project.   Each sprint they get better and learn more.  That makes the next sprint planning meeting much quicker and more accurate.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One particular team always had a bowl of gummy bears on the table when they had their planning meetings.  So everybody grabbed a handful and put them on the table in front of themselves.    As they considered each task they would each put a certain number of bears out in front (like poker) and then explained why they thought that task was easy or hard to do.   After everybody made their bid, the team came to a quick agreement and assigned a number (usually between 1 and 7 bears) to a task.  Then they moved on.  The whole meeting goes pretty quick and soon they have a set of tasks to do in the sprint and assign those to capable engineers.    Done. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why something silly? Well many teams got a little more formal and ended up calling them \"<a href=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/points-estimates-in/\"><strong>Story Points</strong></a>\". The main idea is that it is a concept that each team uses to judge relative difficulty based on what they are capable of . You DON\'T want to use some real unit of time (like hours or days or weeks). Because once you do that, you have driven a stake in the ground and committed yourself to actually getting it done on that schedule. This leads to short cuts, burn out, and slipped schedules.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, what does it really mean to the team?  That is up to the team.  They have their own way of relating the effort for a specific task based on what similar tasks have been in their past.   Also, what ends up happening is that since their knowledge of the tasks grows and they get quicker at understanding and finishing tasks, they find out that they are getting faster at getting the tasks done.  We call this \"team velocity\".   As they get better they can get more gummy bears or story points done in a single sprint.    This is a very rewarding and motivating way of planning.  It is empowering.   The alternative of setting hard deadlines and then missing them or getting done too early is very de-motivating.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Much more to come...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->','How To Do Easy Time Estimates','','inherit','closed','closed','','404-revision-v1','','','2024-05-07 04:10:47','2024-05-07 04:10:47','',404,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=414',0,'revision','',0);

(429,1,'2024-05-07 20:38:42','2024-05-07 20:38:42','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-420\" style=\"width: 30px;\" src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/New.jpg\" alt=\"\">One of the most critical and least successful parts of software development is estimating how long a project is going to take and meeting those estimates.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Long ago projects were small and done by small teams of highly motivated engineers. They had an idea of something good to build and they just dove in and started writing code. These were the pioneering days and most of these projects are called <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project\">skunk-works projects</a>.</strong> They often worked long hours and did not tell anyone what they built until it worked. Some famous projects were <strong>UNIX</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, the <strong>Macintosh Personal Computer</strong>, and other little things.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, as time went on and people started paying big money for big computers and needed big complex software, the whole process got big and complicated. Lots of money was raised, lots of people were hired, and customers were anxious to get the final product. This meant that you had to make promises of functionality and set dates for delivery. This meant that a lot of success was riding on getting it right. This was the era of the <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">waterfall method</a> </strong>of project planning. These projects costs many millions of dollars and often took many years to build. IBM was THE BIG player in such projects. They would often start several teams in different places of the world and give them all the same project. That caused a lot of competition between the teams. This is because as some teams fell behind their project was cancelled and the people often fired. In the end one team was selected as the victor. Many of these large projects involved multiple companies collaborating, and the end result was often gigantic failures.  Some examples are the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics\">Multics</a> operating system, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taligent\">Taligent</a>.  I\'ll bet you have never heard of either of them. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There were a handful of pioneers that decided there had to be a better way of project planning. One of the results of those efforts became a group of methods under the umbrella term<strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development\">Agile Software Development</a>.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are two stories I wish to share that are a quick introduction to Agile techniques.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Chicken and the Pig</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.michaelvizdos.com/resources/scrum-chicken-pig-cartoon-origin\">The cartoon: </a> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One day <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig\"><strong>a Chicken and a Pig</strong></a> decided they would open a restaurant together. As they each decided what they could contribute to the effort it became clear that they were very different from each other in their investment. The chicken pointed out that she could lay eggs almost every day, and with her fellow chickens they could bring fresh eggs to cook every day. However, when the pig volunteered its ham, he realized that his and his friends investment was a one time all in investment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What this funny story shows is that the \"boss\" or project sponsor has a small investment and he can have many projects some of which might succeed and some might fail.   However, the workers that worked full time on the project were investing their very livelihoods and all of their time.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agile moral of this story is that the boss gets to decide what the project should build and how it needs to function for the customer, but his interest stops there.  His job is to hire a team that are qualified to do the job, guide them along the way, and get them the resources they need to do the job.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The team however, gets to determine how they will organize the work, plan the schedule, and get the job done.  They are day to day, week by week, coordinating and working together as best they can to get it done on time and to requirements.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gummy Bears</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gummy_bear\">Gummy Bears are a favorite snack of children and software engineers. </a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many of the early agile teams wanted a quick and easy way to make rough estimates of the work required and how best to organize the effort.  They wanted to spend only a little time on the estimate and then simply get to work.   As they worked they kept rough track of the time spent on each task they had estimated and after every week or two (called a sprint like in Rugby) they took a few minutes to reflect on the sprint and their estimates versus actuals.   The idea is to slowly get better and better at estimating the effort for small pieces of the work so they could more accurately plan and finish small to large parts of the overall project.   Each sprint they get better and learn more.  That makes the next sprint planning meeting much quicker and more accurate.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One particular team always had a bowl of gummy bears on the table when they had their planning meetings.  So everybody grabbed a handful and put them on the table in front of themselves.    As they considered each task they would each put a certain number of bears out in front (like poker) and then explained why they thought that task was easy or hard to do.   After everybody made their bid, the team came to a quick agreement and assigned a number (usually between 1 and 7 bears) to a task.  Then they moved on.  The whole meeting goes pretty quick and soon they have a set of tasks to do in the sprint and assign those to capable engineers.    Done. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why something silly? Well many teams got a little more formal and ended up calling them \"<a href=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/points-estimates-in/\"><strong>Story Points</strong></a>\". The main idea is that it is a concept that each team uses to judge relative difficulty based on what they are capable of . You DON\'T want to use some real unit of time (like hours or days or weeks). Because once you do that, you have driven a stake in the ground and committed yourself to actually getting it done on that schedule. This leads to short cuts, burn out, and slipped schedules.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, what does it really mean to the team?  That is up to the team.  They have their own way of relating the effort for a specific task based on what similar tasks have been in their past.   Also, what ends up happening is that since their knowledge of the tasks grows and they get quicker at understanding and finishing tasks, they find out that they are getting faster at getting the tasks done.  We call this \"team velocity\".   As they get better they can get more gummy bears or story points done in a single sprint.    This is a very rewarding and motivating way of planning.  It is empowering.   The alternative of setting hard deadlines and then missing them or getting done too early is very de-motivating.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Much more to come...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->','How To Do Easy Time Estimates','','inherit','closed','closed','','404-revision-v1','','','2024-05-07 20:38:42','2024-05-07 20:38:42','',404,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=429',0,'revision','',0),

Not only do I use it in my browser, but I also have my clone of the repository inside a working full stack server.   So, I am testing it as it will be fully deployed for the world to see and use.    I am also using a testing framework called <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software)\">Selenium</a> </strong>to automate the manual tests that I do.  As I manually do the testing,  Selenium captures all of my actions (click here, type there, scroll to somewhere else, ...) and the results of my actions.

When Efatha and Philemon are working on a new feature or fixing a bug, they will be able to push a button and watch all of my testing get replayed against their new code.

One thing certainly is multitasking. It is rare that a single person, using their browser to view a web page, is the only user at that specific site. The back end is run on a more powerful machine that can server up web pages to many users around the world at the same time.

There is certainly no surprise there.  The work is complicated and with everybody busy working on their assigned issues in the same project repository it is inevitable that we would discover issues that we did not anticipate.   We can choose to view these as setbacks, but they really are a reality and more importantly an opportunity for learning and process improvements. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take for instance the fact that both Efatha and Philemon were creating different versions of basically the same application.   It is not unusual for a web page to be called <strong>index.html</strong>.   The other complicating factor is that they both decided that since their pages were just test versions of what we hope to be the real application for this project, they would put their files in the /test directory.  Efatha pushed his first and when Philemon got around to pushing his copy from his repository there were now two \'test/index.html\' files that pushed.

The first lesson is that <strong>these kinds of issues that block progress must be communicated in the Issues list of the project repository.</strong>   Each of them were working on their own top level story.

That way when each team member reviews the Issues list they see that Efatha is stuck in his primary issue.   In addition to applying the label, Efatha should have simply added a comment to the issue explaining his problem.   That way when I and/or Philemon reviews the issues list (which should be done daily) we would quickly see that Efatha\'s primary task was \"Stuck!\".   Then we would simply open that discussion and see the problem.    So, early this morning I did what Efatha did not yet know he could have done.   In our meeting we discussed it and figured out the solution.   Part of the solution is that we now need a new issue.   </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>That new issue is \"<strong>#10 We need to decide the top level structure of our demo project.</strong>\"  I entered that and explained the problem and my proposal for how to setup the directory structure and how to name files.   I also created a new label colored red: <strong>\"High Priority!!\"</strong>.   If you hover over that label it explains: <strong>\"Drop what you are doing and pay attention!\"</strong>. The purpose of this label is a visual cue that each team member when daily reviewing the Issue board would see this and do as suggested.  They should suspend their normal work, open the new issue and read about the situation.   They would then read my suggestion and enter a comment that would either agree with my proposal or propose an alternative solution.   Sometimes they may decide it\'s not up to them, and they should enter a comment to that effect and then move on with their normal work.  This issue was not really new because Ash had commented that when reviewing Efatha\'s push for his issue #5.   But, since it was just a comment in a list of comments nobody paid close enough attention to realize the importance.   When I took Ash\'s comment and made a new issue of it, I also added <strong>\"High Priority!!\"</strong>.   Now, each team member should notice that, read the conversation, and add their comment.   Quickly we should arrive at a consensus opinion that someone should take responsibility to implement a solution.  When that solution is in place and pushed, they will update it with a comment that should cause the rest of the team to review their fix and comment that they agree that the solution fixes the problem.  At that point someone will remove the <strong>\"High Priority!!\"</strong> label. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One more example of these labels is in Philemon\'s <strong>Issue #6: \"creation of the json file structure and javascript code\" </strong>which is his \"Active\" \"Main story\".

This is an important security mandate and rightly so.    However, our desire to write to the /responses folder is only a temporary solution which will go away when Ash gets a backend server running that allows our code to send the Json data directly to the backend for permanent storage.     So, I proposed a temporary workaround that allows us to demo his code, see the submitted json file, and get it stored.  As a result, I added the <strong>\"Stuck!\"</strong> label and explained the problem and my proposed solution.  I finished my comment with this: \"<strong>Give it a try.

There is certainly no surprise there.  The work is complicated and with everybody busy working on their assigned issues in the same project repository it is inevitable that we would discover issues that we did not anticipate.   We can choose to view these as setbacks, but they really are a reality and more importantly an opportunity for learning and process improvements. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take for instance the fact that both Efatha and Philemon were creating different versions of basically the same application.   It is not unusual for a web page to be called <strong>index.html</strong>.   The other complicating factor is that they both decided that since their pages were just test versions of what we hope to be the real application for this project, they would put their files in the /test directory.  Efatha pushed his first and when Philemon got around to pushing his copy from his repository there were now two \'test/index.html\' files that pushed.

Efatha is doing the HTML and CSS work to build the look and feel of the <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/front-end-web/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"49\"><strong>front end</strong></a> of the survey application. At the same time, Philemon is coding the JavaScript code to read in the actual survey questions and to write the survey answers to data storage. They are collaborating on the same program day by day using their own unique skills. As they do so, they are doing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review\"><strong>code reviews</strong></a> of each other\'s new code so that they understand how the pieces fit together and to make sure that the result meets the requirements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meanwhile, I (Michael) am monitoring their code commits and reviewing their code.  I also have a cloned copy of the project repository on my development machine here in Texas.   My contribution to the project is to manually test the working program as the end user (whose name is Fred) would.   Not only do I use it in my browser, but I also have my clone of the repository inside a working full stack server.   So, I am testing it as it will be fully deployed for the world to see and use.    I am also using a testing framework called <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software)\">Selenium</a> </strong>to automate the manual tests that I do.  As I manually do the testing,  Selenium captures all of my actions (click here, type there, scroll to somewhere else, ...) and the results of my actions.   After my test run, the captured actions are stored in a \"test case\" in the team\'s testing library.   Those test cases (and results) become part of the project repository that we all share.   When Efatha and Philemon are working on a new feature or fixing a bug, they will be able to push a button and watch all of my testing get replayed against their new code.  This way, they can quickly re-run all of my testing to make sure they have not broken anything.

This will allow us to ask questions, discuss options and next steps, and more importantly get a very tangible reward of their first week of working globally as a team.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Way to go team!</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you read this post, please leave a comment here so we may know your personal take away from this team\'s efforts.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Post 5: The cohort #1 team is busy!','','inherit','closed','closed','','436-revision-v1','','','2024-06-02 19:58:54','2024-06-02 19:58:54','',436,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=460',0,'revision','',0),
(461,1,'2024-06-02 19:59:27','2024-06-02 19:59:27','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Last week as the cohort-1 team was busy working on their respective parts of the demo project they hit a few speed bumps.    There is certainly no surprise there.  The work is complicated and with everybody busy working on their assigned issues in the same project repository it is inevitable that we would discover issues that we did not anticipate.   We can choose to view these as setbacks, but they really are a reality and more importantly an opportunity for learning and process improvements. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take for instance the fact that both Efatha and Philemon were creating different versions of basically the same application.   It is not unusual for a web page to be called <strong>index.html</strong>.   The other complicating factor is that they both decided that since their pages were just test versions of what we hope to be the real application for this project, they would put their files in the /test directory.  Efatha pushed his first and when Philemon got around to pushing his copy from his repository there were now two \'test/index.html\' files that pushed.   When Philemon merged his into the shared GitHub repository there was a conflict.   The end result is that his code overwrote Efatha\'s.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Efatha was a bit surprised by this and he was confused as to how he should proceed.  He set about trying to figure out what to do about it.   He commented to me in a message in the Upwork discussion, and I said I would look into it.   However, the Upwork discussions are unique to each developer and myself.  When he asked me what to do, Philemon was not notified of the issue.   Until I figured it out, I was having two private conversations and I became the middle man.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the important principles of team dynamics is that at some level each team member should have a high level view of what the other team members are doing and any problems they might encounter.   Since we were communicating these issues through private Upwork messages there was not a common view of the situation.    The first lesson is that <strong>these kinds of issues that block progress must be communicated in the Issues list of the project repository.</strong>   Each of them were working on their own top level story.   Efatha\'s story was Issue #5, and Philemon\'s was Issue #6.   They were each focused on their issue and not seeing what was happening to the other.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The proper way to communicate these kinds of issues is for everybody to have a common view of the project, the issues each person is working on, and most important any high priority issues.   The solution is a proper set of Issue labels.  I added new labels to the issues list:   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>A bright purple label named <strong>\"Stuck !!\"</strong> is to be applied to an active issue that gets stuck.  In Efatha\'s case the \"Issue #5 creating the form with html and css\" now needs a \"Stuck!\" label.   That way when each team member reviews the Issues list they see that Efatha is stuck in his primary issue.   In addition to applying the label, Efatha should have simply added a comment to the issue explaining his problem.   That way when I and/or Philemon reviews the issues list (which should be done daily) we would quickly see that Efatha\'s primary task was \"Stuck!\".   Then we would simply open that discussion and see the problem.    So, early this morning I did what Efatha did not yet know he could have done.   In our meeting we discussed it and figured out the solution.   Part of the solution is that we now need a new issue.   </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>That new issue is \"<strong>#10 We need to decide the top level structure of our demo project.</strong>\"  I entered that and explained the problem and my proposal for how to setup the directory structure and how to name files.   I also created a new label colored red: <strong>\"High Priority!!\"</strong>.   If you hover over that label it explains: <strong>\"Drop what you are doing and pay attention!\"</strong>. The purpose of this label is a visual cue that each team member when daily reviewing the Issue board would see this and do as suggested.  They should suspend their normal work, open the new issue and read about the situation.   They would then read my suggestion and enter a comment that would either agree with my proposal or propose an alternative solution.   Sometimes they may decide it\'s not up to them, and they should enter a comment to that effect and then move on with their normal work.  This issue was not really new because Ash had commented that when reviewing Efatha\'s push for his issue #5.   But, since it was just a comment in a list of comments nobody paid close enough attention to realize the importance.   When I took Ash\'s comment and made a new issue of it, I also added <strong>\"High Priority!!\"</strong>.   Now, each team member should notice that, read the conversation, and add their comment.   Quickly we should arrive at a consensus opinion that someone should take responsibility to implement a solution.  When that solution is in place and pushed, they will update it with a comment that should cause the rest of the team to review their fix and comment that they agree that the solution fixes the problem.  At that point someone will remove the <strong>\"High Priority!!\"</strong> label. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One more example of these labels is in Philemon\'s <strong>Issue #6: \"creation of the json file structure and javascript code\" </strong>which is his \"Active\" \"Main story\".   During his demo of the current state of that,  he mentioned the problem that browsers don\'t allow Javascript code to write files to the user\'s local filesystem.    This is an important security mandate and rightly so.    However, our desire to write to the /responses folder is only a temporary solution which will go away when Ash gets a backend server running that allows our code to send the Json data directly to the backend for permanent storage.     So, I proposed a temporary workaround that allows us to demo his code, see the submitted json file, and get it stored.  As a result, I added the <strong>\"Stuck!\"</strong> label and explained the problem and my proposed solution.  I finished my comment with this: \"<strong>Give it a try. If that works for you, add a comment here and then remove the Stuck!! label and move on .</strong>\"   When Philemon sees my suggestion and tries it, and agrees that it works, he will comment to that effect, remove the \"Stuck!!\" label and then move on with his work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The bottom line on this post is:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>We have new labels that get attention and cause the team to act.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Each team member should daily take a look at the issues list and look for the labels \"bug\", \"Stuck!\", and \"High Priority!!\" and then stop and consider their role in the solution. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Each team member is empowered, encouraged, an able to enter new issues and add or remove labels to them as appropriate.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, please digest this post, make an effort to add these tools to your toolbox, and then comment on this post so I know you have absorbed and commit to applying these tools.

Rather, I\'ll discuss some of the unique attributes of each and how they relate.   You have probably already chosen a favorite platform, but may also be considering some alternatives.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Linux</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Almost all web hosting servers are running Linux so ultimately if you are going to do full stack development you will need to learn Linux.   Many developers have chosen to also use Linux as their local work computer.  We will discuss hosting servers a little later on this page, but for now we will consider Linux as a local development computer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Linux of course can be installed on PC\'s and Macintoshes.   It can be installed in a virtual machine on either of those platforms.   It also can run native on Windows using <a href=\"https://cygwin.com\">Cygwin</a> which gives an existing Windows user the ability to use both Windows apps and Linux apps interchangeably.   That also eases the Linux learning curve.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>MacOS is based on Unix and the Mac Terminal app depends on Unix (Linux) shells for line mode interactive commands.   There are many different shells available to choose from, but the most commonly used one in my experience is BASH.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you choose to run Linux as your native OS then you will almost always use a graphical user interface.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Windows</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With Windows you naturally have a graphical interface including Windows Explorer,  a web browser like InternetExplorer or Edge, an interactive command line tool like PowerShell or cmd.exe.   Using your browser there are applications galore that you can download and install.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition as mentioned above you can also install <a href=\"https://cygwin.com\">Cygwin</a> and get lots of Linux goodies as well.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Macintosh</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As mentioned above MacOS is really UNIX under the covers.   The Terminal window runs many different UNIX shells.   Many common development tools are available for download and install and ready for use.     </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, since Terminal gets you into the core of UNIX there are many UNIX, and Linux package managers available that will let you install just like you are in Linux.  Homebrew is one option.   Just Google \'<a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?hps=1&amp;q=package+managers+for+mac&amp;ia=web\">package managers for mac</a>\'</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Web hosting servers</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most servers are virtual machines in a cloud server farms. These are almost always headless meaning there is no display or keyboard. You must access these using some form of secure shell. Checkout a google of \'<a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ssh&amp;t=osx&amp;ia=web\">ssh</a>\'. ssh and many programs that use it require secure certificates to be generated and installed on your local machine. I will have a whole \'How to\' page dedicated to secure networking.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-420\" style=\"width: 50px;\" src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/New.jpg\" alt=\"\">With multiple developers working to build a hosted server, there are two indispensable tools.   One, just mentioned is an <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\">SSH</a> client</strong> that allows interactive terminal access as though the developer was directly typing on a terminal attached to the server machine.    I have discovered an app called <strong><a href=\"https://termius.com\">Termius</a></strong> that does this very well.  It also serves as a secure file transfer program (<strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol\">SFTP</a></strong>).   I have dedicated a page specifically for this tool and how it can be used.    <strong>Termius as a secure interactive shell and file transfer client.</strong> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How about you? </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Give all of those options you probably already have a development platform of some sort and it\'s now time to talk about it.

They had an idea of something good to build and they just dove in and started writing code. These were the pioneering days and most of these projects are called <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project\">skunk-works projects</a>.</strong> They often worked long hours and did not tell anyone what they built until it worked. Some famous projects were <strong>UNIX</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, the <strong>Macintosh Personal Computer</strong>, and other little things.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, as time went on and people started paying big money for big computers and needed big complex software, the whole process got big and complicated. Lots of money was raised, lots of people were hired, and customers were anxious to get the final product. This meant that you had to make promises of functionality and set dates for delivery. This meant that a lot of success was riding on getting it right. This was the era of the <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">waterfall method</a> </strong>of project planning. These projects costs many millions of dollars and often took many years to build. IBM was THE BIG player in such projects. They would often start several teams in different places of the world and give them all the same project. That caused a lot of competition between the teams. This is because as some teams fell behind their project was cancelled and the people often fired. In the end one team was selected as the victor. Many of these large projects involved multiple companies collaborating, and the end result was often gigantic failures.  Some examples are the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics\">Multics</a> operating system, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taligent\">Taligent</a>.  I\'ll bet you have never heard of either of them. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There were a handful of pioneers that decided there had to be a better way of project planning. One of the results of those efforts became a group of methods under the umbrella term<strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development\">Agile Software Development</a>.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are two stories I wish to share that are a quick introduction to Agile techniques.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Chicken and the Pig</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.michaelvizdos.com/resources/scrum-chicken-pig-cartoon-origin\">The cartoon: </a> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One day <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig\"><strong>a Chicken and a Pig</strong></a> decided they would open a restaurant together. As they each decided what they could contribute to the effort it became clear that they were very different from each other in their investment. The chicken pointed out that she could lay eggs almost every day, and with her fellow chickens they could bring fresh eggs to cook every day. However, when the pig volunteered its ham, he realized that his and his friends investment was a one time all in investment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What this funny story shows is that the \"boss\" or project sponsor has a small investment and he can have many projects some of which might succeed and some might fail.   However, the workers that worked full time on the project were investing their very livelihoods and all of their time.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agile moral of this story is that the boss gets to decide what the project should build and how it needs to function for the customer, but his interest stops there.  His job is to hire a team that are qualified to do the job, guide them along the way, and get them the resources they need to do the job.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The team however, gets to determine how they will organize the work, plan the schedule, and get the job done.  They are day to day, week by week, coordinating and working together as best they can to get it done on time and to requirements.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gummy Bears</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gummy_bear\">Gummy Bears are a favorite snack of children and software engineers. </a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many of the early agile teams wanted a quick and easy way to make rough estimates of the work required and how best to organize the effort.  They wanted to spend only a little time on the estimate and then simply get to work.   As they worked they kept rough track of the time spent on each task they had estimated and after every week or two (called a sprint like in Rugby) they took a few minutes to reflect on the sprint and their estimates versus actuals.   The idea is to slowly get better and better at estimating the effort for small pieces of the work so they could more accurately plan and finish small to large parts of the overall project.   Each sprint they get better and learn more.  That makes the next sprint planning meeting much quicker and more accurate.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One particular team always had a bowl of gummy bears on the table when they had their planning meetings.  So everybody grabbed a handful and put them on the table in front of themselves.    As they considered each task they would each put a certain number of bears out in front (like poker) and then explained why they thought that task was easy or hard to do.   After everybody made their bid, the team came to a quick agreement and assigned a number (usually between 1 and 7 bears) to a task.  Then they moved on.  The whole meeting goes pretty quick and soon they have a set of tasks to do in the sprint and assign those to capable engineers.    Done. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why something silly? Well many teams got a little more formal and ended up calling them \"<a href=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/points-estimates-in/\"><strong>Story Points</strong></a>\". The main idea is that it is a concept that each team uses to judge relative difficulty based on what they are capable of . You DON\'T want to use some real unit of time (like hours or days or weeks). Because once you do that, you have driven a stake in the ground and committed yourself to actually getting it done on that schedule. This leads to short cuts, burn out, and slipped schedules.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, what does it really mean to the team?  That is up to the team.  They have their own way of relating the effort for a specific task based on what similar tasks have been in their past.   Also, what ends up happening is that since their knowledge of the tasks grows and they get quicker at understanding and finishing tasks, they find out that they are getting faster at getting the tasks done.  We call this \"team velocity\".   As they get better they can get more gummy bears or story points done in a single sprint.    This is a very rewarding and motivating way of planning.  It is empowering.   The alternative of setting hard deadlines and then missing them or getting done too early is very de-motivating.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Much more to come...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->','How To Do Easy Time Estimates','','inherit','closed','closed','','404-revision-v1','','','2024-06-02 21:38:00','2024-06-02 21:38:00','',404,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=474',0,'revision','',0),
(475,1,'2024-06-02 21:58:57','2024-06-02 21:58:57','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As mentioned in the <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/work-globally/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"59\">Work globally page</a>, GitHub is an excellent way to keep a repository of a software project. A WordPress site is no exception. However, a WordPress site is significantly different than normal software projects in several regards:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>There is a lot of WordPress itself, as well as its Themes and Plugins that are contained in the public_html directory. That is OK, and it\'s worthwhile tracking changes to those files. For one, it is a good way to detect corruption in a site.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>The vast majority of the content of a WP site is in posts and pages. When an author writes a blog post or a page of any sort, it does not create any new web pages in public_html. This is a result of the fact that WP contains a powerful CMS (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\">ContentManagementSystem</a>). A CMS manages the content in a database not a directory full of fully rendered HTML pages. This is discussed more in the <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/full-stack/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"55\">Full stack</a> page. The actual content of a blog post or a page is stored as a separate record in the wp_posts table. Blog posts have a post_type of \'post\' and pages (like this one) have a post_type of \'page\'. There are in fact a number of other things that get stored in the wp_posts table. As a result of these items stored as records in a table, doing the GitHub tracking of the text of a file will not show changes in individual posts or pages.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dumping the SQL data for source control</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><p>Because the main visible content is stored in a database table it is necessary to extract the individual records of the wp_posts (and other tables) to textual form so the normal GitHub mechanisms can show it in a readable form. As a first step to doing that, I have written a shells script called \'<strong>dumpall</strong>\' that is kept in the public_html directory (for now). That script is run in a shell process on the WP host site before a Git commit and push commands are run to update the GitHub repository. This is step 1 in the GitHub issue #10 of the GitHub repository\'. Later, I will write a program to extract each record of the wp_posts table into a separate text file in a .data/posts directory. It will require some nicer format than a simple SQL dump.</p><br><p>One issue with the <strong>dumpall¬†</strong>script is that the SQL dump for a specific table creates an INSERT statement to create all records into the table, but all of those records are written to a single line. ¬†Thus when GitHub tries to show the differences between subsequent revisions of a file, it looks like one VERY long line with lots of differences. ¬† What I would rather have is an INSERT statement that puts each record on a separate line. ¬† I have written a shell alias that uses the sed command to split that INSERT line into many lines. ¬† Thus, in the .data directory of my GitHub repository you will see the original SQL dump in a file named <strong>wp_posts.sql</strong> and a version with the lines split named <strong>wp_posts.split.sql</strong>. ¬†I am pushing this change on Wednesday April 17th, 2024 so you should see the text of this post will be changed in the <strong>wp_posts.split.sql</strong> file.</p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dumping the markup for all pages and posts </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition to saving the SQL tables generally, I want to export the text of all the Pages and Posts as separate files.   This allows GitHub change tracking to present the textual changes to the posts and pages individually.    To do this I wrote two shell scripts named <strong>dumpPages</strong> and <strong>dumpPosts</strong>.   dumpPages uses the wp command line utility to get each page markup text into a file in the .pages directory.

The actual content of a blog post or a page is stored as a separate record in the wp_posts table. Blog posts have a post_type of \'post\' and pages (like this one) have a post_type of \'page\'.

You can see it <a href=\"https://github.com/ElGautinho/My-first-tutorial-project\">yourself on GitHub</a>.  One thing I like about his project is that it has an immediate application of organizing the efforts of other volunteers in the media group at his church. The visual style of his page is very cool and well layed out. It has a pleasant but subdued graphic in the background with a clear and well balanced form in the center. He has used some simple text entry fields, a multiple choice button group, a pulldown selector, a sequence of checkboxes and a larger text box for comments and suggestions. He has coded value validation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The primary purpose of this exercise is the use of GitHub projects.   His README.md file is thorough.   It has a small table of contents up front.  It describes the purpose of the project he is building, and a description of the process he is using to build the project.  He describes the tools and techniques he is using, and has a start of a list of the lessons he has learned so far in the project.     </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He is using the Issues list feature of the project to list the 13 major steps in his process so far.  Each issue has a short description, and he is including the issue number and a short description of each of the 18 commits.   This helps me as a reviewer to quickly understand the intent, design, and process as well as what each commit contained.     <strong>Well done Gauthier!</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Samuel Bulangalizi</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":709,\"width\":\"345px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3765-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-709\" style=\"width:345px;height:auto\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Samuel\'s</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Samuel11s/My-first-tutorial-project\">project for Task 7 </a> has a nice README.md file.   He describes his objectives, the features of the page,  the technology he will use to achieve it.  He describes the process he will follow with a rough schedule.   In his list of requirements the first is to learn basic Javascript.   This was a problem in his plan to build this page because Javascript is a lot to learn.    This is a worthwhile endeavor but it will delay the completion of his project.   He has done well in using the Issues feature of GitHub.  There are 6 closed issues, four of which he created and two of which I added.   These 6 he has completed and closed them.   There are 3 issues remaining, one of which is learning Javascript.    When I review the 11 commits he has made to his code I notice that he has entered good descriptions which allows me as a reviewer to know what the commit was for without having to open each to understand.   <strong>The main point of this task </strong>was to learn how to use the features of a GitHub project to complete a project and I think Samuel has done a fine job of demonstrating that knowledge.   From what he has coded already I can see that he knows how to design and layout a page well.  Well done Samuel, you have learned this lesson and I\'m confident that you will complete your project when you have learned the required Javascript. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Salomon Mwilo</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":710,\"width\":\"382px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PXL_20240905_095856292.SK-I-901x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-710\" style=\"width:382px;height:auto\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Salomon\'s</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Salomonmwilo/My-first-tutorial-project\">project for Task 7</a> shows good progress already.

That is the result of their demo project.  There is a direct link to that survey app and also a link to the GitHub repository they worked on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next, return to finish the ‚Äò<strong>About</strong>‚Äô page.  Find yourself in <strong>Cohort-2</strong> section, and read that section and this <strong>Cohort-2 </strong>page as well very carefully. Take notes of any questions you have.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. The final section of the \'<strong>About</strong>\' page: Read the <strong>contributors</strong> section and the pages it links to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you get to the individual contributions pages notice that they have both edited and/or written several pages for this site.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4.

Update time tracker as usual starting task 4.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. Using the table of contents on the site, go read the ‚Äò<strong>Front end web</strong>‚Äô page. Read it carefully.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. As you read, make note for each section, whether you already know that information well, what you know a little bit, and what sections are new to you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. In the areas you don‚Äôt know well, take some time to follow some of the many links provided. Don‚Äôt study them in detail, but read enough to see what is discussed and what you may want to revisit at a later date.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5. In the section about HTML and the Hello World page, take the time to actually try that for yourself. In the browser notice the address bar of your browser that the url uses the ‚Äò<a href=\"file://\'/\">file://\'</a>protocol.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>6. When you get to the HTTP section, read that closely to understand how visiting a we page via http:// is different from file://</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>7 When you are done with task 4, take the survey ‚Äòread-front-end-web -page‚Äô. You will be asked there to relate some of the notes you talk when reading this page.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8. Leave a comment at the bottom of the page and indicate something you learned on that page.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9. Update time tracker to indicate you are done with task 4.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Task 5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read ‚ÄòBack end web‚Äô page.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. Start your timekeeping as usual.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. In the introduction paragraphs make note of the two key differences between the Front end, and the Back end.  The differences have to do with the programs involved and where those programs run. Make sure you can briefly explain those differences.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. Read the wikipedia page on \'Frontend and backend\'. See if you can learn what \'client side\' and \'server side\' mean and which programs run in each.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. Read the wikipedia page on LAMP.  See if you can find the \'Stack\' concept in the illustrations and make a list of what is in the stack.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5. In the \'Key Components\' section notice some of the programming languages that can be used and identify which languages you already know something about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>6. Pay attention to the section on \'Frameworks\' and research one of those frameworks enough to know why it would be used.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>7. In the \'Essential Skills...\' section, note which of those skills you think you should begin learning, and why?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8. In the \'Common Tools and Technologies\' section, are there any tools you already know something about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9. In the \'Best Practices\' section, follow the link on \'Code Reviews\' and note two of the benefits of code reviews that would help you most at this time. You will be doing some code reviews with your mentor very soon.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>10. Take the survey named <strong>Read-backend</strong>, and finish your time accounting. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Task 6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read ‚ÄòFull stack‚Äô page.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. Start your timekeeping as usual.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2.  The Full stack page covers the concepts of front end and back end, but at a higher level.  This page emphasizes the expert level of knowledge needed to bring all of the front end and back end skills together to make a full web based application.   At your level of learning, you are not expected to gain this knowledge, but it is important that you are aware that someone has to put it all together.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. What the Full stack page does not yet tell you is the importance of security.  We are just now starting to explore security issues in the <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/security/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"583\">Security page</a> and some blog posts discussed there.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. Although this page leads to many other technologies to create full stack solutions, it also points out that for many purposes WordPress is a full stack solution that is open source and contains more advanced technologies that are available.  This is why I (Michael) chose WordPress to build this training site.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5. Spend some time on this page just to be familiar with it, and return to it later when you have advanced in both front end and back end development and are ready to take on more.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>6. Take the \'<strong>read-full-stack</strong>\' survey, then finish up your time keeping. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Task 7:&nbsp;&nbsp;Read ‚ÄòWork globally‚Äô page and take the two challenges it mentions.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You should now have taken challenges 1 through 4.

But, many hackers are not looking for valuables, they are looking to cause trouble.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Is your social media presence valuable to you?  What if your account were hacked and a malicious person decides to post nasty things while posing as you?  What would that do to your relationships and social trust?   What if your work account was hacked and your companies private information was stolen or damaged?  Even if you don\'t control any valuable information (not likely), if a hacker gets in your login account they can use that to launch a cyber attack on many sites.  Many hosting services will quickly detect such an attack and their response is to simply shut down the machine.  Now, you and your co-workers can\'t login to work the next day, and maybe the day after.

It\'s been around for years and is cross platform.  My wife and I share an account and it synchronizes to all of our devices and operating systems.   It uses biometrics where supported.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Good password managers also contain a feature that checks the security of your passwords.   1Password calls that feature \'Watchtower\'.

I also recommend an ssh (and sftp) program called Termius that has a password vault built in.  Once I have unlocked Termius and connect to a site, it automatically retrieves the username and password from its vault.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Call to action:</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You should have followed each link and chosen your five most important passwords.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>How strong were they?  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>How long would it take to crack them?  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Did you decide to change them? </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Where did you store the new better password? </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Have you considered a password manager?</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>How secure are your accounts now?  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are one of my students, you <strong>MUST</strong> leave a comment on this post and answer each of those questions.

But, we have all been advised that it is important to have good passwords to keep our digital lives secure.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Think of the types of accounts that you might have:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter er X, Instagram) </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Email account (me@gmail.com)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Online shopping (Amazon.com)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Online banking (checking account, PayPal, credit card)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Freelancing profile (Upwork.com)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Software repositories (GitHub.com)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Smart phone</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Personal computer</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Work account </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just think if those were not password protected.    You might think that some of those accounts are not that important because you don\'t have anything terribly valuable.  But consider that thieves and hackers don\'t know that you don\'t have anything valuable.  They just hack and if they get in they look for valuables.   But, many hackers are not looking for valuables, they are looking to cause trouble.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Is your social media presence valuable to you?  What if your account were hacked and a malicious person decides to post nasty things while posing as you?  What would that do to your relationships and social trust?   What if your work account was hacked and your companies private information was stolen or damaged?  Even if you don\'t control any valuable information (not likely), if a hacker gets in your login account they can use that to launch a cyber attack on many sites.  Many hosting services will quickly detect such an attack and their response is to simply shut down the machine.  Now, you and your co-workers can\'t login to work the next day, and maybe the day after.   Not good.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Consider that list and you decide what the value is on just five of those accounts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What makes a good or bad password?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, open a separate browser window or tab on this: <a href=\"https://www.passwordmonster.com\">https://www.passwordmonster.com</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In that page, you can type in the passwords that protect your privacy.  Pay attention to the \"Time to crack your password:\" </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, go read this article: <a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/password-manager/the-most-common-passwords-weakest-passwords\">https://www.techopedia.com/password-manager/the-most-common-passwords-weakest-passwords</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where to store your passwords?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Assuming that you have now created some great passwords, you may realize that you are NOT going to be able to remember them.   Please don\'t write it on a sticky note on your keyboard!!   (I\'ve seen it done!).  The previous article mentioned several good password vault programs.  I personally use 1Password.  It\'s been around for years and is cross platform.  My wife and I share an account and it synchronizes to all of our devices and operating systems.   It uses biometrics where supported.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Good password managers also contain a feature that checks the security of your passwords.   1Password calls that feature \'Watchtower\'.  With one click it checks all of my passwords.   It evaluates:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>The strength of each password</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>checks for passwords used for multiple sites (very bad idea)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>websites which are known to have been compromised (your password is at risk)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>unsecured websites (http:// rather than https://) More about this soon...</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>sites that offer two-factor authentication that you are not using but should</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>sites that support Passkeys (much more secure than even two-factor)  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, you often need your passwords handy in your web browser and your ssh terminal program.   1Password (and others) have plugins to most browsers so it is at the ready to plugin your password when a sites prompts you to login.   I also recommend an ssh (and sftp) program called Termius that has a password vault built in.  Once I have unlocked Termius and connect to a site, it automatically retrieves the username and password from its vault.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Call to action:</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You should have followed each link and chosen your five most important passwords.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>How strong were they?  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>How long would it take to crack them?  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Did you decide to change them? </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Where did you store the new better password? </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Have you considered a password manager?</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>How secure are your accounts now?  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are one of my students, you <strong>MUST</strong> leave a comment on this post and answer each of those questions.

You really need to be trusted by the service you are using.   However, the flip side to that is that you want there to be NO OTHER PEOPLE that can impersonate you.

However, from its inception the internet was a trusting place so the connections did not need built-in security.   Originally, it was university researchers sharing information with other researchers.  There was an inherent trust in that community.    But, then many people and companies started using the internet for many different reasons, most legitimate, but unfortunately many are malicious.

Certificates do both of those things.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you enter a URL or click on a link, the URL starts with a protocol string which is either HTTP:// or HTTP<strong>S</strong>://.

It involves working with databases, servers, application logic, and APIs to ensure that the front-end, or client-side, can communicate effectively with the server and perform tasks such as data retrieval, storage, and processing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"justify\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">While the front end is mostly concerned with the actual presentation of web information, there is much that the web browser cannot do. One thing certainly is multitasking. It is rare that a single person, using their browser to view a web page, is the only user at that specific site. The back end is run on a more powerful machine that can server up web pages to many users around the world at the same time. This concept is described in detail in the Wikipedia <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend\">Frontend and backend</a> page.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"justify\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">To make the back end work there are actually a number of servers running together that enable many web users to share access to a website. These servers are all run as services by a system administrator and have inter dependancies. So, the various servers have to know how to access each other to get the job done. Since they work together we refer to the whole as a \'stack\'.

While our process includes lots of communication tools, we must continue to be consistent with the <strong>Upwork</strong> process which is important for accountability for both the client and the talent.   You need to learn this skill well if you want to engage other clients, which is the purpose of this training.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you get confused or can‚Äôt follow a specific step, please use the <strong>Upwork</strong> message system to let me know so I, or your mentor, can walk you through it.

As you read, make note for each section, whether you already know that information well, what you know a little bit, and what sections are new to you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. In the areas you don‚Äôt know well, take some time to follow some of the many links provided.

Start your timekeeping as usual.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. In the introduction paragraphs make note of the two key differences between the Front end, and the Back end.  The differences have to do with the programs involved and where those programs run. Make sure you can briefly explain those differences.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. Read the wikipedia page on \'Frontend and backend\'. See if you can learn what \'client side\' and \'server side\' mean and which programs run in each.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. Read the wikipedia page on LAMP.  See if you can find the \'Stack\' concept in the illustrations and make a list of what is in the stack.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5. In the \'Key Components\' section notice some of the programming languages that can be used and identify which languages you already know something about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>6. Pay attention to the section on \'Frameworks\' and research one of those frameworks enough to know why it would be used.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>7. In the \'Essential Skills...\' section, note which of those skills you think you should begin learning, and why?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8. In the \'Common Tools and Technologies\' section, are there any tools you already know something about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9.

Take the survey named <strong>Read-backend</strong>, and finish your time accounting. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Task 6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read ‚ÄòFull stack‚Äô page.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. Start your timekeeping as usual.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2.  The Full stack page covers the concepts of front end and back end, but at a higher level.  This page emphasizes the expert level of knowledge needed to bring all of the front end and back end skills together to make a full web based application.   At your level of learning, you are not expected to gain this knowledge, but it is important that you are aware that someone has to put it all together.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. What the Full stack page does not yet tell you is the importance of security.  We are just now starting to explore security issues in the <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/security/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"583\">Security page</a> and some blog posts discussed there.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. Although this page leads to many other technologies to create full stack solutions, it also points out that for many purposes WordPress is a full stack solution that is open source and contains more advanced technologies that are available.  This is why I (Michael) chose WordPress to build this training site.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5.

Once your mentor has accepted your invitation you can begin working.  First, you should edit your README.md file to describe the web development challenge you have chosen.   While you can type just simple text into this file, the file extension of .md indicates that this file can contain Markdown, which is a lot more than simple text.  You don\'t need to learn all about Markdown, but a simple tutorial page is this one from w3schools.io:  <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.io/file/markdown-introduction/\">Markdown Tutorials</a>.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using markdown syntax you can indicate where your challenge comes from and why you chose that one.  Make sure you include a link to the source of the challenge.   You and your mentor can discuss what you hope to learn from this challenge.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many things that are appropriate for a Github repository README.md file, but that will come later.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Start reading the instructions for your challenge.  It should guide you through the process of setting up your project.   Before you start the actual work, you need to use Github Desktop or one of the other similar programs.  You can also choose one of the web development IDE programs that include GitHub support.    VS Code is a popular choice.   Using those tools, create a local clone of your repository so you have a working copy on your machine that you can edit, debug, and test the code you develop.     Usually in challenges, the first step is to download a set of files that form the starting material.   Go ahead and do that, but don\'t actually start working yet.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 6</strong>.  Using the tools in your IDE or other Git desktop program, commit the starting materials with an explanation code of \'download starting materials\'.  Then push that to GitHub.   This allows your mentor and anyone else to see your starting point.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 7</strong>. From this point forward, you should work in small increments.  Read the instructions for a small amount of work, then <strong>create a new Issue</strong> in GitHub describing the requirements of that step and how you propose to implement it.  At first you should take some time to think through what you are going to do and describe the changes you need to accomplish it.  Assign that issue to yourself, but also include your mentor so that he is notified when you make new notes and especially when you commit and push changes. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> Use your tools, and reference to tutorial materials to implement the change you need to implement what is described in your new issue.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 9.</strong>  Test and debug your new changes.  If a test is more than trivial like just looking at your page in your web browser, you should write a test description.  I suggest creating a \'test\' directory inside your project, then create a text file to describe the step by step process of setting up and executing the test.    This may seem too trivial but it is a very important step and will become much more important as your work progresses.   Specifically, name the test file descriptively so that someone else can know what issue you were working on and what specifically you are testing.  Your mentor is likely to want to use your test file to exercise your code when you push your changes for this issue.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 10.</strong> When you are confident you have addressed that issue, go ahead and commit and push.  Make sure your commit message clearly indicates the issue being addressed.  You will see later why that is important.    When you do the push, you should also add a note to the issue so your mentor knows that you pushed a significant change that he should review.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 11.</strong>  Review your work.   When your mentor is notified of your update to the issue, he will be able to go to the GitHub project and see your commit.   If you have not learned this yet, let me take a moment to describe it.    With every commit, not only are the changes to the files pushed to GitHub, but in the Code tab, at the top of the list of files you will see an indication of the latest commit.  It will give the name of the person, the explanation of the commit, and usually a link to the issue that is being addressed.   Too the right of that, you should see the date of the commit.  Finally, if there is enough room on the page, it should tell you how many total commits there have been.  If you don\'t see that, then grow the page or shrink the text until it appears.    If you click on that, you will see a complete list of all commits.  Take a look at one now, either in your project or any other GitHub project.   Each item in that list is a link that will show you a list of all the files changed and an annotated portion of the source that was changed.   Lines that were removed are highlighted in red with a \'-\' minus sign in the left margin.  Lines added are highlighted in green with a \'+\'.  Finally, notice at the bottom of the commit page there is another text box for you or more likely your mentor to comment on the changes you made.   This can start a discussion where your mentor points out something you could have done different, or asks a question about why you made the change you did.   This will be a very fruitful discussion, and you will learn a lot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have done as I suggested and written a test case file, that should be included in the commit and the source will now be in the repository.  Your mentor is likely to inspect that file and run your test.  He may notice other problems, or perhaps pointed out good aspects of the way you made your change.    This discussion is called a \'<strong>Code Review</strong>\'.  We will talk about those in a future lesson.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is possible that your mentor may suggest yet another change either as an additional note in the Issue you were working on, or possibly he will have created another issue.    If it is another issue, then you may be able to proceed with your work as planned, knowing that you have a new issue that can be addressed later in your process.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 12. </strong> If the code review was successful and your work was approved you should add one final note to the Issue page and rather than pressing the green Comment button, you can press the other button labeled \'Close with comment\'.  That indicates that the issue is resolved.   At this point, you can go back to Step 7 where you choose another small unit of work and create a new issue to discuss and resolve that work.  This process continues until the whole project is complete.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 13.</strong>  Finish your project.   But, finishing requires one more step and that is to cleanup and complete your README.md file.    First, read this article from FreeCodeCamp about \'<strong><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/\">How to Write a good README File for Your GitHub Project.</a></strong>\'   It is especially important to do this step well.   You will also want to put a link to your GitHub repository in your Upwork profile.   It is important that clients considering you for a job be able to not just see a list of what you think you know, but to see an actual project that demonstrates your knowledge and skill.   Having followed all the instructions in this challenge will ensure that a client can read your repository and see how you work.   You will be demonstrating not only your skill in coding but also your professional discipline and teamwork.    Make sure the README.md file is a good overall summary of your project.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Step 14.</strong> There will soon be a survey to complete showing that you have completed this challenge.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Challenge: capture a tutorial project in a GitHub repository','','inherit','closed','closed','','222-revision-v1','','','2024-07-20 21:34:36','2024-07-20 21:34:36','',222,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=605',0,'revision','',0),

They may also refer to standards organizations documentation sites such as <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/\"><strong>W3Schools</strong></a>.    These are good approaches because the student is focused on learning and doing specific simple things that produce tangible results quickly.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This phase of learning will usually take months or years to learn enough to feel confident to be able to take on a large project or a full-time employment.   However, those challenges are much bigger than knowing how to do a lot of specific tasks.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the principles that I focus on teaching fairly early in my training is to start teaching the bigger picture issues little by little during this initial learning curve.  The reason I do this is so that the student has a larger long range conceptual picture of what is required to \"go pro\".   Examples of that are my pages on <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/work-globally/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"59\">Work Globally</a>\'</strong>, <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/working-in-a-professional-team/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"149\">Working in a team\'</a>,</strong> and \'<strong><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/finding-work/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"79\">Finding Work</a>\'</strong>.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This page on <strong>Software Design</strong> is another key big picture item that I think beginners need to start learning and embracing early in their development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the symptoms of a new developer that has not begun to learn software design is what I call the \'<strong>code snippet collection</strong>\'. When building a web page to fetch some data, massage it some, and present it in a table, the beginner takes each piece of the job and either recalls or googles for code snippets. Then they stack those together to get the specific job done. For larger projects they simply repeat that process as many times as necessary. This results in many problems, one of which is \'<strong>fragile code</strong>\'. Fragile code is code that breaks in unpredictable ways when something in the code itself or the environment or even code it depends on changes. For example, if your HTML calls some javascript code to import some data and your program needs to run in a different environment, you may have to change your code to use a different language syntax or call a different API that has a different calling sequence. When this happens you have to go to <strong>ALL</strong> of the places in your code that does that specific thing and change them all. If you don\'t get them all right your program is broken and you might not have tested all of those places. This can be an extremely time consuming process, and such tedious tasks often get sloppy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another problem is \'<strong>inconsistent behavior</strong>\'.   If you need to code something that is similar, but not identical to something you have done, you may end up getting a snippet that implements some action in a different way.   This will trip up your users and if you document your solution you will end up describing features and their exceptions.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These are just a few examples of issues that lead to project overruns, very expensive maintenance and customer dissatisfaction.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Solution: </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The biggest solution to those problems is to be able to easily understand the larger picture of the finished product, how it is built, and what is really required.  You can\'t do that by reading all of the code in a project.   You need a top down approach that teaches the big ideas and then works down to the details. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many large projects have failed because they attempted to write very detailed requirements and design documentation. It\'s easy to see how that approach worked out by simply reading the Wikipedia page on \'<strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">Waterfall Model</a></strong>\'. The retrospective motto of this way of working is \'<em><strong>If you are going to fail, you might as well fail BIG.</strong>\'</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I said above, software design should be learned incrementally and early. This means that the concepts and processes of design should start out as simple as possible and only get more complex as needed for the job at hand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Paradigm: Object-oriented programming:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every person begins to learn the world around them as a collection of Objects. An object is simply a thing in the environment that is identifiable, has a set of identifiable properties, and a fairly consistent behavior. A toddler is crawling on the floor and encounters that family pet, the cat. The cat is cute, is furry, and has four legs. It makes a meow sound and likes to rub against things. It will play with things left on the floor. If you pull on its tail, sharp things come out of the legs and scratch or cut you. The family may have more than one cat and they are different sizes and colors, but they mostly behave the same. The dog however is a different animal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From our earliest days we encounter many different objects and learn to classify them and anticipate their properties.   As our world becomes more complex we simply develop more sophisticated understanding of objects and their classes.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The beauty of object-oriented languages is that their syntax can be extremely simple yet extremely intuitive.    One of the earliest programming languages that is still in use today is <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk\">Smalltalk</a></strong>.   Smalltalk was created in the 1970s and yet is still used for educational and commercial projects to this day.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That wikipedia page is only 16 pages printed on paper and yet it describes the concepts, history, syntax, and runtime environment.    In fact, the entire syntax of the language fits on a postcard: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":704,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Pharo-syntax-PostCard.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-704\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you want a thorough explanation of the syntax and usage, well, that takes two whole pages: <a href=\"http://files.pharo.org/media/pharoCheatSheet.pdf\">http://files.pharo.org/media/pharoCheatSheet.pdf</a>.

There is no other syntax besides that.   The Smalltalk programmer can see all of the code for every part of the system and all the libraries needed.   It\'s all objects. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you learn the basics objects and the simple syntax of an object, you are well on your way.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My purpose of this section is NOT to advocate for the use of Smalltalk.  I\'m using it as an example of the simplicity and power of a language and runtime that is pure object-oriented.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For a more thorough discussion on object oriented languages and Smalltalk see this article : <a href=\"https://medium.com/@etherservices.vimalraj/are-there-purely-object-oriented-languages-d9a569361f58\">Are There Purely Object Oriented Languages?</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pure Object-Oriented languages versus \"Supports Objects\"</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As far as I know, Smalltalk is the most pure OO language. But, there are many other languages that support definition of Objects but the basic design of the language is not object oriented. Javascript is one of them.  I won\'t wade into the open and endless debate but instead, refer you to this <a href=\"http://Javascript supports &quot;objects&quot; and &quot;classes&quot;, but the basic syntax and runtime is not object oriented.   In javascript variables can be a list of name-value pairs.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107464/is-javascript-object-oriented\">StackOverflow thread.</a> For the purpose of this Software Design discussion, I will say that the main features of OO that make it a very powerful and simple language are NOT present in Javascript.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>But</strong>, more importantly, the Object-Oriented paradigm applies to software design whether or not you use an Object-Oriented language for your code. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Object-Oriented design</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I will discuss two OO design techniques that are relevant to this site and its training for beginning developers: Unified Modeling Language and CRC. UML is a very powerful visually oriented way of describing a design. I am a visual learner. For me a picture is worth way more than a thousand words. If I have to read a design description, I will get a piece of paper, and diagram what I am reading. With a diagram you can actually point your finger at things and trace their relationships to other things. There are people that can describe complex things in words in very vivid terms. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman\">Richard Feynman</a> is perhaps one of the best. He has a series of lectures to ordinary college classes in which he describes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics\">Quantum Mechanics</a> (which he was the major contributor to) in ways that make me say \"OH! I get it now.\". But, he was a very brilliant and gifted professor. Most engineers can\'t describe designs like that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I will describe UML more thoroughly shortly, but it is beyond what is needed to begin to understand software design at the beginning level.    Instead, I will begin with CRC cards.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design on a postcard:  CRC - Class Responsibility Collaborator</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<p>A precursor to the UML was an intentionally simplified method of describing the basics of Object-Oriented software design. <br /><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-responsibility-collaboration_card\">Wikipedia has a good page describing this </a>that should be required reading (Read it!).</p>\n<p>CRC cards were written on 3x5\" index cards during a design session. As the team discussed the design, whenever they determined they needed a new class they would grab a blank card and write the basics then put the card on the table. When a new card was introduced it would be laid next to the cards that it relates to, and its name was written on the \'collaborators\' section of those cards. As the team discussed the design they would rearrange the cards and talk their way through common usage scenarios.</p>\n<p>This is admittedly a very simple design process, but it proved to be very effective and low cost design method.</p>\n<p>There are simple web applications to create CRC cards, but that is usually more formal than necessary. ¬† I find that pen and paper works best. ¬†¬†</p>\n<p>Images of some CRC Cards and a CRC design.</p>\n<p>[gallery type=\"rectangular\" ids=\"615,616,617,618,619,620\"]</p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design by diagram:  Unified Modeling Language.</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<p>UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language\">Wikipedia describes the history of its development.</a></p>\n<p><strong>For full disclosure:</strong> <br />I am a HUGE proponent of the use of UML. I used it extensively during my career<br />at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_Institute\">SAS Institute</a>. I was one of the employees that was part of the origins of the formalized use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata\">metadata</a>. ¬† Metadata is a fancy term for information about data. ¬†One of the simplest forms of metadata is the filesystem on your computer. ¬†You create a directory called a Git repository. ¬†Inside the repository you create files. ¬†The files have names like README.md and index.html. ¬† The name tells you generally what it represents and the file extension tells you the language and the program needed to edit or present it (eg. .md for markdown, .html you can edit in a text program or a programming IDE, and you run it in a web browser. ¬† ¬†Other metadata is the date and time the file was modified, its size, and more. ¬†</p>\n<p>The original metadata database for SAS products was written for a single specific project. It was called the \"<strong>Metabase</strong>\" (Metadata database) written in a SAS proprietary object-oriented language called SCL (Screen Control Language). It was written by one guy while flat on his back in the hospital after back surgery. He knew the details of how data and programs were described in our products and wrote SCL code to model that. If the details changed he would have to go back into the SCL and modify it to match. ¬†Since this was a fairly simple model, that was not too much effort.</p>\n<p>However, when it was decided that all metadata for all SAS\' many products would be incorporated into a single metadata model, it was quite a huge task. ¬†See the <a href=\"https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/omamodref/67417/HTML/default/viewer.htm#hierlist.htm\">product documentation of the metadata model</a>. ¬†There are 172 different data types described. My team\'s job was to implement a metadata server that would provide access to the storage of all of that metadata for all <a href=\"https://support.sas.com/en/software/all-products-support.html\">300+ SAS products</a>. ¬†Those products were growing and changing constantly. ¬†To implement all of that by hand coding classes was a monstrous job that would have taken a large team years to implement and maintained.</p>\n<p>I thought there was a better way. I attended a software development conference called <strong>SD2000</strong> in San Jose, California (where I went to university). Several of the presenters were the pioneers in the latest software development methodologies and technologies. I took what I learned there and came back to work. I pitched the idea of using the UML language and the applications to build and manage the model<br />as a tool. One of our team members learned to used those modeling tools, and her job was to visit with the development teams for all SAS products. She learned what metadata they needed to to make their product work and built a standardized model that unified all metadata for all those products.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I wrote a program called ModelCompiler (in Java) which would read in that model from the tools and generate C source code to implement the model in the<br /><a href=\"https://support.sas.com/en/software/metadata-server-support.html\">metadata server that our team built</a>. ¬† That code was compiled and linked into our products so that they could access the server. ¬† By the way, the product documentation shown in the link above for the SAS metadata model is also generated using the UML model.</p>\n<p>Even though the most visible part of a UML model is the diagrams, the underlying model that describes all of those details is stored in a rich database. ¬† The diagrams are drawn automatically using drawing algorithms. ¬† There is also text and lists and lots of other representations. ¬† Since the model is a live database, it is possible to write programs that navigate through the details in that database and generate almost any kind of representation, including source code, and HTML diagrams.¬†</p>\n<h3>Examples of Object Oriented design and implementation:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/software-design/object-design-of-a-bible-study-application/\">A design and implementation of a program to read and deeply study the Bible.</a></li>\n</ul>','Software Design','','publish','closed','closed','','software-design','','','2024-10-12 16:46:39','2024-10-12 16:46:39','',0,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?page_id=609',0,'page','',0),

They may also refer to standards organizations documentation sites such as <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/\"><strong>W3Schools</strong></a>.    These are good approaches because the student is focused on learning and doing specific simple things that produce tangible results quickly.   </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This phase of learning will usually take months or years to learn enough to feel confident to be able to take on a large project or a full-time employment.   However, those challenges are much bigger than knowing how to do a lot of specific tasks.  </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>One of the principles that I focus on teaching fairly early in my training is to start teaching the bigger picture issues little by little during this initial learning curve.  The reason I do this is so that the student has a larger long range conceptual picture of what is required to \"go pro\".   Examples of that are my pages on <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/work-globally/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"59\">Work Globally</a>\'</strong>, <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/working-in-a-professional-team/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"149\">Working in a team\'</a>,</strong> and \'<strong><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/finding-work/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"79\">Finding Work</a>\'</strong>.   </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This page on Software Design is another key big picture item that I think beginners need to start learning and embracing early in their development.   </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>One of the symptoms of a new developer that has not begun to learn software design is what I call the \'<strong>code snippet collection</strong>\'.  When building a web page to fetch some data, massage it some, and present it in a table, they take each piece of the job and either recall or google for code snippets.    Then they stack those together to get the specific job done.    For larger projects they simply repeat that process as many times as necessary.    This results in many problems, one of which is \'<strong>fragile code</strong>\'.  Fragile code is code that breaks in unpredictable ways when something in the code itself or the environment or even code it depends on changes.   For example, if your HTML calls some javascript code to import some data and your program needs to run in a different environment, you may have to change your code to use a different language syntax or call a different API that has a different calling sequence.   When this happens you have to go to ALL of the places in your code that does that and change them all.  If you don\'t get them all right your program is broken and you might not have tested all of those places.   This can be an extremely time consuming process, and such tedious tasks often get sloppy.  </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Another problem is \'<strong>inconsistent behavior</strong>\'.   If you need to code something that is similar, but not identical to something you have done, you may end up getting a snippet that implements some action in a different way.   This will trip up your users and if you document your solution you will end up describing features and their exceptions.   </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>These are just a few examples of issues that lead to project overruns, very expensive maintenance and customer dissatisfaction.    </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Solution: </h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The biggest solution to those problems is to be able to easily understand the larger picture of the finished product, how it is built, and what is really required.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Many large projects have failed because they attempted to write very detailed requirements and design documentation.   It\'s easy to see how that approach worked out by simply reading the Wikipedia page on \'<strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">Waterfall Model</a></strong>\'.  The retrospective motto of this way of working is \'<em>If you are going to fail, you might as well fail BIG.\'</em></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>As I said above, software design should be learned incrementally and early.   This means that the concepts and processes of design should start out as simple as possible and only get more complex as needed.   </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Paradigm: Object-oriented programming:</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Every person begins to learn the world around them as a collection of Objects.   An object is simply a thing in the environment that is identifiable, has a set of identifiable properties, and a fairly constant behavior.     A toddler is crawling on the floor and encounters that family pet, a cat.   The cat is cute, is furry, and has four legs.  It makes a meow sound and likes to rub against things.  It will play with things left on the floor.   If you pull on its tail, sharp things come out of the legs and scratch or cut you.    The family may have more than one cat and they are different sizes and colors, but they mostly behave the same.    The dog however is a different animal. </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>From our earliest days we encounter many different objects and learn to classify them and anticipate their properties.

I used it extensively during my career<br />at [SAS Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_Institute).  I was one of the employees that was part of the origins of the formalized use of <br />[metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata).<br />The original metadata database for SAS products was written for a single specific project.  <br />It was called the \"Metabase\" (Metadata database) written in a SAS Proprietary object-oriented language<br />called SCL (Screen Control Language).   It was written by one guy while flat on his back in the hospital<br />after back surgery.   He knew the details of how data and programs were described in our products and <br />wrote SCL code to model that.  If the details changed he would have to go back into the SCL and modify it <br />to match.   Since this was a fairly simple model, that was not too much effort.</p>\n<p>However, when it was decided that all metadata for all SAS\' many products would be incorporated into a<br />single metadata model, it was quite a huge task.  <br />[See the product documentation of the metadata model](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/omamodref/67417/HTML/default/viewer.htm#hierlist.htm).<br />There are 172 different data types described.   My team\'s job was to implement a metadata server that would<br />provide access to the storage of all of that metadata for <br />[all 300+ SAS products](https://support.sas.com/en/software/all-products-support.html)<br />Those products were growing and changing constantly.  <br />To implement all of that by hand coding classes was a monstrous job that would have taken a large team<br />years to implement and maintained.  </p>\n<p>I thought there was a better way.

One of our team members learned to used those modeling tools, and her job was to visit with<br />the development teams for all SAS products.  She learned what metadata they needed to to make their product <br />work and built a standardized model that unified all metadata for all those products.  </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I wrote a program called ModelCompiler (in Java) which would read in that model from the tools<br />and generate C source code to implement the model in the<br />[metadata server that our team built](https://support.sas.com/en/software/metadata-server-support.html). <br />That code was compiled and linked into our products so that they could access the server.</p>','Software Design','','inherit','closed','closed','','609-revision-v1','','','2024-08-31 22:35:52','2024-08-31 22:35:52','',609,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=621',0,'revision','',0),

They may also refer to standards organizations documentation sites such as <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/\"><strong>W3Schools</strong></a>.    These are good approaches because the student is focused on learning and doing specific simple things that produce tangible results quickly.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This phase of learning will usually take months or years to learn enough to feel confident to be able to take on a large project or a full-time employment.   However, those challenges are much bigger than knowing how to do a lot of specific tasks.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the principles that I focus on teaching fairly early in my training is to start teaching the bigger picture issues little by little during this initial learning curve.  The reason I do this is so that the student has a larger long range conceptual picture of what is required to \"go pro\".   Examples of that are my pages on <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/work-globally/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"59\">Work Globally</a>\'</strong>, <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/working-in-a-professional-team/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"149\">Working in a team\'</a>,</strong> and \'<strong><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/finding-work/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"79\">Finding Work</a>\'</strong>.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This page on Software Design is another key big picture item that I think beginners need to start learning and embracing early in their development.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the symptoms of a new developer that has not begun to learn software design is what I call the \'<strong>code snippet collection</strong>\'.  When building a web page to fetch some data, massage it some, and present it in a table, they take each piece of the job and either recall or google for code snippets.    Then they stack those together to get the specific job done.    For larger projects they simply repeat that process as many times as necessary.    This results in many problems, one of which is \'<strong>fragile code</strong>\'.  Fragile code is code that breaks in unpredictable ways when something in the code itself or the environment or even code it depends on changes.   For example, if your HTML calls some javascript code to import some data and your program needs to run in a different environment, you may have to change your code to use a different language syntax or call a different API that has a different calling sequence.   When this happens you have to go to ALL of the places in your code that does that and change them all.  If you don\'t get them all right your program is broken and you might not have tested all of those places.   This can be an extremely time consuming process, and such tedious tasks often get sloppy.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another problem is \'<strong>inconsistent behavior</strong>\'.   If you need to code something that is similar, but not identical to something you have done, you may end up getting a snippet that implements some action in a different way.   This will trip up your users and if you document your solution you will end up describing features and their exceptions.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These are just a few examples of issues that lead to project overruns, very expensive maintenance and customer dissatisfaction.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Solution: </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The biggest solution to those problems is to be able to easily understand the larger picture of the finished product, how it is built, and what is really required.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many large projects have failed because they attempted to write very detailed requirements and design documentation.

These are good approaches because the student is focused on learning and doing specific simple things that produce tangible results quickly.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This phase of learning will usually take months or years to learn enough to feel confident to be able to take on a large project or a full-time employment.   However, those challenges are much bigger than knowing how to do a lot of specific tasks.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the principles that I focus on teaching fairly early in my training is to start teaching the bigger picture issues little by little during this initial learning curve.  The reason I do this is so that the student has a larger long range conceptual picture of what is required to \"go pro\".   Examples of that are my pages on <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/work-globally/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"59\">Work Globally</a>\'</strong>, <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/working-in-a-professional-team/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"149\">Working in a team\'</a>,</strong> and \'<strong><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/finding-work/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"79\">Finding Work</a>\'</strong>.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This page on <strong>Software Design</strong> is another key big picture item that I think beginners need to start learning and embracing early in their development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the symptoms of a new developer that has not begun to learn software design is what I call the \'<strong>code snippet collection</strong>\'. When building a web page to fetch some data, massage it some, and present it in a table, the beginner takes each piece of the job and either recalls or googles for code snippets. Then they stack those together to get the specific job done. For larger projects they simply repeat that process as many times as necessary. This results in many problems, one of which is \'<strong>fragile code</strong>\'. Fragile code is code that breaks in unpredictable ways when something in the code itself or the environment or even code it depends on changes. For example, if your HTML calls some javascript code to import some data and your program needs to run in a different environment, you may have to change your code to use a different language syntax or call a different API that has a different calling sequence. When this happens you have to go to <strong>ALL</strong> of the places in your code that does that specific thing and change them all. If you don\'t get them all right your program is broken and you might not have tested all of those places. This can be an extremely time consuming process, and such tedious tasks often get sloppy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another problem is \'<strong>inconsistent behavior</strong>\'.   If you need to code something that is similar, but not identical to something you have done, you may end up getting a snippet that implements some action in a different way.   This will trip up your users and if you document your solution you will end up describing features and their exceptions.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These are just a few examples of issues that lead to project overruns, very expensive maintenance and customer dissatisfaction.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Solution: </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The biggest solution to those problems is to be able to easily understand the larger picture of the finished product, how it is built, and what is really required.  You can\'t do that by reading all of the code in a project.   You need a top down approach that teaches the big ideas and then works down to the details. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many large projects have failed because they attempted to write very detailed requirements and design documentation. It\'s easy to see how that approach worked out by simply reading the Wikipedia page on \'<strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">Waterfall Model</a></strong>\'. The retrospective motto of this way of working is \'<em><strong>If you are going to fail, you might as well fail BIG.</strong>\'</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I said above, software design should be learned incrementally and early. This means that the concepts and processes of design should start out as simple as possible and only get more complex as needed for the job at hand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Paradigm: Object-oriented programming:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every person begins to learn the world around them as a collection of Objects. An object is simply a thing in the environment that is identifiable, has a set of identifiable properties, and a fairly consistent behavior. A toddler is crawling on the floor and encounters that family pet, the cat. The cat is cute, is furry, and has four legs. It makes a meow sound and likes to rub against things. It will play with things left on the floor. If you pull on its tail, sharp things come out of the legs and scratch or cut you. The family may have more than one cat and they are different sizes and colors, but they mostly behave the same. The dog however is a different animal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From our earliest days we encounter many different objects and learn to classify them and anticipate their properties.   As our world becomes more complex we simply develop more sophisticated understanding of objects and their classes.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The beauty of object-oriented languages is that their syntax can be extremely simple yet extremely intuitive.    One of the earliest programming languages that is still in use today is <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk\">Smalltalk</a></strong>.   Smalltalk was created in the 1970s and yet is still used for educational and commercial projects to this day.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That wikipedia page is only 16 pages printed on paper and yet it describes the concepts, history, syntax, and runtime environment.

UML is a very powerful visually oriented way of describing a design. I am a visual learner. For me a picture is worth way more than a thousand words. If I have to read a design description, I will get a piece of paper, and diagram what I am reading. With a diagram you can actually point your finger at things and trace their relationships to other things. There are people that can describe complex things in words in very vivid terms. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman\">Richard Feynman</a> is perhaps one of the best. He has a series of lectures to ordinary college classes in which he describes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics\">Quantum Mechanics</a> (which he was the major contributor to) in ways that make me say \"OH! I get it now.\". But, he was a very brilliant and gifted professor. Most engineers can\'t describe designs like that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I will describe UML more thoroughly shortly, but it is beyond what is needed to begin to understand software design at the beginning level.    Instead, I will begin with CRC cards.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design on a postcard:  CRC - Class Responsibility Collaborator</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<p>A precursor to the UML was an intentionally simplified method of describing the basics of Object-Oriented software design. <br /><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-responsibility-collaboration_card\">Wikipedia has a good page describing this </a>that should be required reading (Read it!).</p>\n<p>CRC cards were written on 3x5\" index cards during a design session. As the team discussed the design, whenever they determined they needed a new class they would grab a blank card and write the basics then put the card on the table. When a new card was introduced it would be laid next to the cards that it relates to, and its name was written on the \'collaborators\' section of those cards. As the team discussed the design they would rearrange the cards and talk their way through common usage scenarios.</p>\n<p>This is admittedly a very simple design process, but it proved to be very effective and low cost design method.</p>\n<p>There are simple web applications to create CRC cards, but that is usually more formal than necessary. ¬† I find that pen and paper works best. ¬†¬†</p>\n<p><br />Images of some CRC Cards and a CRC design.</p>\n<p>[gallery type=\"rectangular\" ids=\"615,616,617,618,619,620\"]</p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design by diagram:  Unified Modeling Language.</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<p>UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language\">Wikipedia describes the history of its development.</a></p>\n<p><strong>For full disclosure:</strong> <br />I am a HUGE proponent of the use of UML. I used it extensively during my career<br />at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_Institute\">SAS Institute</a>. I was one of the employees that was part of the origins of the formalized use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata\">metadata</a>. ¬† Metadata is a fancy term for information about data. ¬†One of the simplest forms of metadata is the filesystem on your computer. ¬†You create a directory called a Git repository. ¬†Inside the repository you create files. ¬†The files have names like README.md and index.html. ¬† The name tells you generally what it represents and the file extension tells you the language and the program needed to edit or present it (eg. .md for markdown, .html you can edit in a text program or a programming IDE, and you run it in a web browser. ¬† ¬†Other metadata is the date and time the file was modified, its size, and more. ¬†</p>\n<p>The original metadata database for SAS products was written for a single specific project. It was called the \"<strong>Metabase</strong>\" (Metadata database) written in a SAS proprietary object-oriented language called SCL (Screen Control Language). It was written by one guy while flat on his back in the hospital after back surgery. He knew the details of how data and programs were described in our products and wrote SCL code to model that. If the details changed he would have to go back into the SCL and modify it to match. ¬†Since this was a fairly simple model, that was not too much effort.</p>\n<p>However, when it was decided that all metadata for all SAS\' many products would be incorporated into a single metadata model, it was quite a huge task. ¬†See the <a href=\"https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/omamodref/67417/HTML/default/viewer.htm#hierlist.htm\">product documentation of the metadata model</a>. ¬†There are 172 different data types described. My team\'s job was to implement a metadata server that would provide access to the storage of all of that metadata for all <a href=\"https://support.sas.com/en/software/all-products-support.html\">300+ SAS products</a>. ¬†Those products were growing and changing constantly. ¬†To implement all of that by hand coding classes was a monstrous job that would have taken a large team years to implement and maintained.</p>\n<p>I thought there was a better way. I attended a software development conference called <strong>SD2000</strong> in San Jose, California (where I went to university). Several of the presenters were the pioneers in the latest software development methodologies and technologies. I took what I learned there and came back to work. I pitched the idea of using the UML language and the applications to build and manage the model<br />as a tool. One of our team members learned to used those modeling tools, and her job was to visit with the development teams for all SAS products. She learned what metadata they needed to to make their product work and built a standardized model that unified all metadata for all those products.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I wrote a program called ModelCompiler (in Java) which would read in that model from the tools and generate C source code to implement the model in the<br /><a href=\"https://support.sas.com/en/software/metadata-server-support.html\">metadata server that our team built</a>. ¬† That code was compiled and linked into our products so that they could access the server. ¬† By the way, the product documentation shown in the link above for the SAS metadata model is also generated using the UML model.</p>\n<p>Even though the most visible part of a UML model is the diagrams, the underlying model that describes all of those details is stored in a rich database. ¬† The diagrams are drawn automatically using drawing algorithms. ¬† There is also text and lists and lots of other representations. ¬† Since the model is a live database, it is possible to write programs that navigate through the details in that database and generate almost any kind of representation, including source code, and HTML diagrams.¬†</p>\n<h3>Examples of Object Oriented design and implementation:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A design and implementation of a program to read and deeply study the Bible.</li>\n</ul>','Software Design','','inherit','closed','closed','','609-revision-v1','','','2024-09-04 22:08:29','2024-09-04 22:08:29','',609,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=626',0,'revision','',0),

The reason for using translations is so that each person can read a text written in their \"<a href=\"https://www.jesusfilm.org/blog/heart-language/\">heart language</a>\", the language that is usually the native language. As a result, each Bible used today is a translation into a modern language. Therefore, any particular Bible is associated with one of many well known translations. My study Bible is of the <strong>New American Standard Bible (NASB) </strong>translation which was translated from the very best Hebrew and Greek manuscripts. My father\'s childhood Bible is a<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong> (or Authorized version) which was translated mostly from the Latin translation of Saint Jerome. 20th century readers will find the King James rather difficult and olde fashioned. I present those two Bibles showing one of the most well known passages (John 3:16).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"imageCrop\":false,\"linkTo\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default\"><!-- wp:image {\"id\":700,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3747-2-1024x839.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-700\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":642,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3748-1024x903.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-642\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image --></figure>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With those concepts and terms, here is a CRC card that expresses the basic classes of objects:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":664,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3751-1-1024x606.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-664\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From real world object model to software object model</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ideally, the software object model should closely resemble the real world model at the highest level.

But, there is usually not any specific annotations or notes indicating what that <strong>scholar</strong> thought about the reference. I would like to be able to record that information, or write my own. I would also like to indicate the <strong>role</strong> that the reference plays. Examples could be that the verse (or passage) is a <strong>direct quote</strong> from somewhere else, or it could be a <strong>parallel passage</strong> from one of the other gospels. It could be that this verse is either a <strong>prophesy</strong> of something to come, or a <strong>fulfillment</strong> of a prophesy earlier in the Bible.

Since all of the text can be stored in a relational database it is efficient if a specific location can be represented by a simple number so that a relational query can be expressed as a simple range of numbers.   The Bible always contains a small number of books, and each book contains a reasonably small number of chapters, which in turn contain a reasonably small number of verses.  If we assume that all of these numbers are less than 1000, we can encode a location with the following formula:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Location = ( Book number * 1,000,000 ) + ( Chapter number * 1,000 ) + Verse number.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example the Great Commission beginning in Matthew 28:18 would be at location 40,028,018.    Genesis 2:3 would be 1,002,003.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since this concept of location occurs in a number of places in such an application, we could either code this math in all those places, or more efficiently and importantly we should create a new class called Location that would encapsulate this whole calculation and the other details in a single place.   All the other classes in the model would consume the services of the Location class.     This is an example of the way that object oriented design and coding helps greatly in reducing duplicated code, code fragility, and allows future flexibility.    If we applied this logic to another book or a library of books that is significantly larger than the Bible, we would only have to change one piece of code.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Implementations of the model</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I currently have these projects on going to implement this model in two different languages and implementations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/BibleModel\">MichaelKentBurns / BibleModel</a> - A Node.js JavaScript implementation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/BibleModel-Pharo\">MichaelKentBurns / BibleModel-Pharo</a> - A Pharo Smalltalk implementation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Object Design of a Bible Study Application.','','publish','closed','closed','','object-design-of-a-bible-study-application','','','2024-12-10 22:55:47','2024-12-10 22:55:47','',609,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?page_id=627',0,'page','',0),

Furthermore, to make the text more manageable it was divided into chapters (usually a page or so long) in the 1200\'s and then smaller verses within a chapter (usually about a sentence).   The chapters and verses within a chapter are simply numbered starting with 1. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When we refer to a certain collection of verses (for example The Lord\'s Prayer, or The Sermon on the Mount) we refer to the Book name, the starting chapter and verse and a dash and ending verse.

Finally, scholars have supplied many footnotes that explain details that the average reader might not know regarding a verse.  These are printed like footnotes in other books, except that rather than including a footnote number in square brackets, the footnotes are annotated to refer to the verse they describe.    A typical page of a study Bible looks like these: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"linkTo\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\"><!-- wp:image {\"id\":634,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3741-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-634\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":635,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3742-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-635\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image --></figure>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One final detail is that since the Protestant Reformation, the Bible has been translated from either Latin (used by the Roman Catholic Church since Saint Jerome in around 200 A.D.) or from the original Hebrew and Greek texts.  These translations have been done for around 2000 languages for the New Testament, or 1000 languages for the whole Bible.   The reason for using translations is so that each person can read a text written in their \"heart language\", the language that is usually the native language.      As a result, each Bible used today is a translation into a modern language.   Therefore, any particular Bible is associated with one of many well known translations.   My study Bible is of the New American Translation which was translated from the very best Hebrew and Greek manuscripts.  My father\'s childhood Bible is a King James (or Authorized version) which was translated mostly from the Latin translation of Saint Jerome.     20th century readers will find the King James rather difficult and olde fashioned.   I present those two Bibles showing one of the most well known passages (John 3:16).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"linkTo\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\"><!-- wp:image {\"id\":640,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3747-1024x775.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-640\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":642,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3748-1024x903.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-642\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image --></figure>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->','Object Design of a Bible Study Application.','','inherit','closed','closed','','627-revision-v1','','','2024-09-04 23:31:47','2024-09-04 23:31:47','',627,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=661',0,'revision','',0),

For web developers that is usually HTML, CSS, and then later Javascript.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Their learning material is often learning sites such as <a href=\"https://www.frontendmentor.io/\"><strong>FrontEndMentor</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\"><strong>freeCodeCamp</strong></a>.   They may also refer to standards organizations documentation sites such as <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/\"><strong>W3Schools</strong></a>.    These are good approaches because the student is focused on learning and doing specific simple things that produce tangible results quickly.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This phase of learning will usually take months or years to learn enough to feel confident to be able to take on a large project or a full-time employment.   However, those challenges are much bigger than knowing how to do a lot of specific tasks.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the principles that I focus on teaching fairly early in my training is to start teaching the bigger picture issues little by little during this initial learning curve.  The reason I do this is so that the student has a larger long range conceptual picture of what is required to \"go pro\".   Examples of that are my pages on <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/work-globally/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"59\">Work Globally</a>\'</strong>, <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/working-in-a-professional-team/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"149\">Working in a team\'</a>,</strong> and \'<strong><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/finding-work/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"79\">Finding Work</a>\'</strong>.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This page on <strong>Software Design</strong> is another key big picture item that I think beginners need to start learning and embracing early in their development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the symptoms of a new developer that has not begun to learn software design is what I call the \'<strong>code snippet collection</strong>\'. When building a web page to fetch some data, massage it some, and present it in a table, the beginner takes each piece of the job and either recalls or googles for code snippets. Then they stack those together to get the specific job done. For larger projects they simply repeat that process as many times as necessary. This results in many problems, one of which is \'<strong>fragile code</strong>\'. Fragile code is code that breaks in unpredictable ways when something in the code itself or the environment or even code it depends on changes. For example, if your HTML calls some javascript code to import some data and your program needs to run in a different environment, you may have to change your code to use a different language syntax or call a different API that has a different calling sequence. When this happens you have to go to <strong>ALL</strong> of the places in your code that does that specific thing and change them all. If you don\'t get them all right your program is broken and you might not have tested all of those places. This can be an extremely time consuming process, and such tedious tasks often get sloppy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another problem is \'<strong>inconsistent behavior</strong>\'.   If you need to code something that is similar, but not identical to something you have done, you may end up getting a snippet that implements some action in a different way.   This will trip up your users and if you document your solution you will end up describing features and their exceptions.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These are just a few examples of issues that lead to project overruns, very expensive maintenance and customer dissatisfaction.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Solution: </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The biggest solution to those problems is to be able to easily understand the larger picture of the finished product, how it is built, and what is really required.  You can\'t do that by reading all of the code in a project.   You need a top down approach that teaches the big ideas and then works down to the details. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many large projects have failed because they attempted to write very detailed requirements and design documentation. It\'s easy to see how that approach worked out by simply reading the Wikipedia page on \'<strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">Waterfall Model</a></strong>\'. The retrospective motto of this way of working is \'<em><strong>If you are going to fail, you might as well fail BIG.</strong>\'</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I said above, software design should be learned incrementally and early. This means that the concepts and processes of design should start out as simple as possible and only get more complex as needed for the job at hand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Paradigm: Object-oriented programming:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every person begins to learn the world around them as a collection of Objects. An object is simply a thing in the environment that is identifiable, has a set of identifiable properties, and a fairly consistent behavior. A toddler is crawling on the floor and encounters that family pet, the cat. The cat is cute, is furry, and has four legs. It makes a meow sound and likes to rub against things. It will play with things left on the floor. If you pull on its tail, sharp things come out of the legs and scratch or cut you. The family may have more than one cat and they are different sizes and colors, but they mostly behave the same. The dog however is a different animal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From our earliest days we encounter many different objects and learn to classify them and anticipate their properties.   As our world becomes more complex we simply develop more sophisticated understanding of objects and their classes.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The beauty of object-oriented languages is that their syntax can be extremely simple yet extremely intuitive.    One of the earliest programming languages that is still in use today is <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk\">Smalltalk</a></strong>.   Smalltalk was created in the 1970s and yet is still used for educational and commercial projects to this day.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That wikipedia page is only 16 pages printed on paper and yet it describes the concepts, history, syntax, and runtime environment.    In fact, the entire syntax of the language fits on a postcard: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":611,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_2420-1024x657.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-611\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Screenshot</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you want a thorough explanation of the syntax and usage, well, that takes two whole pages:   <a href=\"http://files.pharo.org/media/pharoCheatSheet.pdf\">http://files.pharo.org/media/pharoCheatSheet.pdf</a>.

UML is a very powerful visually oriented way of describing a design. I am a visual learner. For me a picture is worth way more than a thousand words. If I have to read a design description, I will get a piece of paper, and diagram what I am reading. With a diagram you can actually point your finger at things and trace their relationships to other things. There are people that can describe complex things in words in very vivid terms. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman\">Richard Feynman</a> is perhaps one of the best. He has a series of lectures to ordinary college classes in which he describes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics\">Quantum Mechanics</a> (which he was the major contributor to) in ways that make me say \"OH! I get it now.\". But, he was a very brilliant and gifted professor. Most engineers can\'t describe designs like that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I will describe UML more thoroughly shortly, but it is beyond what is needed to begin to understand software design at the beginning level.    Instead, I will begin with CRC cards.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design on a postcard:  CRC - Class Responsibility Collaborator</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<p>A precursor to the UML was an intentionally simplified method of describing the basics of Object-Oriented software design. <br /><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-responsibility-collaboration_card\">Wikipedia has a good page describing this </a>that should be required reading (Read it!).</p>\n<p>CRC cards were written on 3x5\" index cards during a design session. As the team discussed the design, whenever they determined they needed a new class they would grab a blank card and write the basics then put the card on the table. When a new card was introduced it would be laid next to the cards that it relates to, and its name was written on the \'collaborators\' section of those cards. As the team discussed the design they would rearrange the cards and talk their way through common usage scenarios.</p>\n<p>This is admittedly a very simple design process, but it proved to be very effective and low cost design method.</p>\n<p>There are simple web applications to create CRC cards, but that is usually more formal than necessary. ¬† I find that pen and paper works best. ¬†¬†</p>\n<p>Images of some CRC Cards and a CRC design.</p>\n<p>[gallery type=\"rectangular\" ids=\"615,616,617,618,619,620\"]</p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design by diagram:  Unified Modeling Language.</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<p>UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language\">Wikipedia describes the history of its development.</a></p>\n<p><strong>For full disclosure:</strong> <br />I am a HUGE proponent of the use of UML. I used it extensively during my career<br />at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_Institute\">SAS Institute</a>. I was one of the employees that was part of the origins of the formalized use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata\">metadata</a>. ¬† Metadata is a fancy term for information about data. ¬†One of the simplest forms of metadata is the filesystem on your computer. ¬†You create a directory called a Git repository. ¬†Inside the repository you create files. ¬†The files have names like README.md and index.html. ¬† The name tells you generally what it represents and the file extension tells you the language and the program needed to edit or present it (eg. .md for markdown, .html you can edit in a text program or a programming IDE, and you run it in a web browser. ¬† ¬†Other metadata is the date and time the file was modified, its size, and more. ¬†</p>\n<p>The original metadata database for SAS products was written for a single specific project. It was called the \"<strong>Metabase</strong>\" (Metadata database) written in a SAS proprietary object-oriented language called SCL (Screen Control Language). It was written by one guy while flat on his back in the hospital after back surgery. He knew the details of how data and programs were described in our products and wrote SCL code to model that. If the details changed he would have to go back into the SCL and modify it to match. ¬†Since this was a fairly simple model, that was not too much effort.</p>\n<p>However, when it was decided that all metadata for all SAS\' many products would be incorporated into a single metadata model, it was quite a huge task. ¬†See the <a href=\"https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/omamodref/67417/HTML/default/viewer.htm#hierlist.htm\">product documentation of the metadata model</a>. ¬†There are 172 different data types described. My team\'s job was to implement a metadata server that would provide access to the storage of all of that metadata for all <a href=\"https://support.sas.com/en/software/all-products-support.html\">300+ SAS products</a>. ¬†Those products were growing and changing constantly. ¬†To implement all of that by hand coding classes was a monstrous job that would have taken a large team years to implement and maintained.</p>\n<p>I thought there was a better way. I attended a software development conference called <strong>SD2000</strong> in San Jose, California (where I went to university). Several of the presenters were the pioneers in the latest software development methodologies and technologies. I took what I learned there and came back to work. I pitched the idea of using the UML language and the applications to build and manage the model<br />as a tool. One of our team members learned to used those modeling tools, and her job was to visit with the development teams for all SAS products. She learned what metadata they needed to to make their product work and built a standardized model that unified all metadata for all those products.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I wrote a program called ModelCompiler (in Java) which would read in that model from the tools and generate C source code to implement the model in the<br /><a href=\"https://support.sas.com/en/software/metadata-server-support.html\">metadata server that our team built</a>. ¬† That code was compiled and linked into our products so that they could access the server. ¬† By the way, the product documentation shown in the link above for the SAS metadata model is also generated using the UML model.</p>\n<p>Even though the most visible part of a UML model is the diagrams, the underlying model that describes all of those details is stored in a rich database. ¬† The diagrams are drawn automatically using drawing algorithms. ¬† There is also text and lists and lots of other representations. ¬† Since the model is a live database, it is possible to write programs that navigate through the details in that database and generate almost any kind of representation, including source code, and HTML diagrams.¬†</p>\n<h3>Examples of Object Oriented design and implementation:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/software-design/object-design-of-a-bible-study-application/\">A design and implementation of a program to read and deeply study the Bible.</a></li>\n</ul>','Software Design','','inherit','closed','closed','','609-revision-v1','','','2024-09-05 01:02:51','2024-09-05 01:02:51','',609,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=663',0,'revision','',0),

The pages were bundled together and later bound into what we would call a <strong>book</strong>.   For modern readers a book is a bunch of paper bound together with two covers.   In that sense, we can say that the <strong>Bible</strong> is a <strong>Book</strong>.

That technology was not nearly as compact as modern books, so each of the 40 writers wrote in one or more scrolls or codices.    There were 66 of those, 39 in the Old Testament, and 27 in the New Testament.

The earliest Hebrew text was written in only consonants and the vowels were implied.   The reader had to recognize the word and its context and supply the vowel sounds needed.   The earliest Greek text was written in all capital letters without any punctuation, not even spaces between the words.  Again, the reader had to know the text and recognize the words and speak them appropriately.  He also had to supply the punctuation as he read.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As time went on, the scribes copying the text started inserting punctuation in the Greek, and special vowel marks in the Hebrew.     Furthermore, to make the text more manageable it was divided into chapters (usually a page or so long) in the 1200\'s and then smaller verses within a chapter (usually about a sentence).   The chapters and verses within a chapter are simply numbered starting with 1. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When we refer to a certain collection of verses (for example The Lord\'s Prayer, or The Sermon on the Mount) we refer to the Book name, the starting chapter and verse and a dash and ending verse.   The Lord\'s Prayer is Matthew 6:9-13.  The Sermon on the Mount is Matthew chapters 5-7.    This type of collection can be referred to as a <strong>Passage</strong>.  Sometimes a study Bible will have a scholar\'s provided title to describe the content or meaning of the passage.  The passage from Matthew 1:1 through 1: 17 has a title supplied by Charles Ryrie \"<strong>His Background</strong>\".</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the unique features of the Bible is the vast web of relationships between different passages.   Those are referred to as <strong>Cross References</strong>.  They are printed in the margins next to the verse they originate at.   I call that the <strong>Anchor Verse.</strong>  The other end of the reference can be a single verse or a passage.    Finally, scholars have supplied many footnotes that explain details that the average reader might not know regarding a verse.  These are printed like footnotes in other books, except that rather than including a footnote number in square brackets, the footnotes are annotated to refer to the verse they describe.

These translations have been done for around 2000 languages for the New Testament, or 1000 languages for the whole Bible.   The reason for using translations is so that each person can read a text written in their \"heart language\", the language that is usually the native language.      As a result, each Bible used today is a translation into a modern language.   Therefore, any particular Bible is associated with one of many well known translations.   My study Bible is of the New American Translation which was translated from the very best Hebrew and Greek manuscripts.  My father\'s childhood Bible is a King James (or Authorized version) which was translated mostly from the Latin translation of Saint Jerome.     20th century readers will find the King James rather difficult and olde fashioned.

It is also possible that one could access the Books directly from the Bible since each Book is uniquely named.   But, one could select just one of the testaments and then access just the books it contains.   The card also tells us that the important attributes of a Book include its Title and the Author.   Other information could also be added as is typical in many study Bibles.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From a given Book, it is possible to access a single Chapter, or each Chapter in order.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For any given Chapter, one can access specific verses, or a passage of multiple verses, or all the verses in order.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When accessing a Passage, there may be a title comment provided by the author of the study Bible.

Since all of the text can be stored in a relational database it is efficient if a specific location can be represented by a simple number so that a relational query can be expressed as a simple range of numbers.   The Bible always contains a small number of books, and each book contains a reasonably small number of chapters, which in turn contain a reasonably small number of verses.  If we assume that all of these numbers are less than 1000, we can encode a location with the following formula:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Location = ( Book number * 1,000,000 ) + ( Chapter number * 1,000 ) + Verse number.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example the Great Commission beginning in Matthew 28:18 would be at location 40,028,018.    Genesis 2:3 would be 1,002,003.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since this concept of location occurs in a number of places in such an application, we could either code this math in all those places, or more efficiently and importantly we should create a new class called Location that would encapsulate this whole calculation and the other details in a single place.   All the other classes in the model would consume the services of the Location class.     This is an example of the way that object oriented design and coding helps greatly in reducing duplicated code, code fragility, and allows future flexibility.    If we applied this logic to another book or a library of books that is significantly larger than the Bible, we would only have to change one piece of code.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Object Design of a Bible Study Application.','','inherit','closed','closed','','627-revision-v1','','','2024-09-05 03:22:53','2024-09-05 03:22:53','',627,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=665',0,'revision','',0),

Those are referred to as <strong>Cross References</strong>.  They are printed in the margins next to the verse they originate at.   I call that the <strong>Anchor Verse.</strong>  The other end of the reference can be a single verse or a passage.    Finally, scholars have supplied many footnotes that explain details that the average reader might not know regarding a verse.  These are printed like footnotes in other books, except that rather than including a footnote number in square brackets, the footnotes are annotated to refer to the verse they describe.    A typical page of a study Bible looks like these: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"linkTo\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\"><!-- wp:image {\"id\":634,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3741-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-634\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":635,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3742-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-635\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image --></figure>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One final detail is that since the Protestant Reformation, the Bible has been translated from either Latin (used by the Roman Catholic Church since Saint Jerome in around 200 A.D.) or from the original Hebrew and Greek texts.  These translations have been done for around 2000 languages for the New Testament, or 1000 languages for the whole Bible.   The reason for using translations is so that each person can read a text written in their \"heart language\", the language that is usually the native language.      As a result, each Bible used today is a translation into a modern language.   Therefore, any particular Bible is associated with one of many well known translations.   My study Bible is of the New American Translation which was translated from the very best Hebrew and Greek manuscripts.  My father\'s childhood Bible is a King James (or Authorized version) which was translated mostly from the Latin translation of Saint Jerome.     20th century readers will find the King James rather difficult and olde fashioned.   I present those two Bibles showing one of the most well known passages (John 3:16).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"linkTo\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\"><!-- wp:image {\"id\":640,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3747-1024x775.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-640\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":642,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3748-1024x903.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-642\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image --></figure>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With those concepts and terms, here is a CRC card that expresses the basic classes of objects:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":664,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3751-1-1024x606.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-664\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From real world object model to software object model</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ideally, the software object model should closely resemble the real world model at the highest level.

But, there is usually not any specific annotations or notes indicating what that <strong>scholar</strong> thought about the reference.   I would like to be able to record that information, or write my own.   I would  also like to indicate the <strong>role</strong> that the reference plays.  Examples could be that the verse (or passage) is a <strong>direct quote</strong> from somewhere else, or it could be a <strong>parallel passage</strong> from one of the other gospels.   It could be that this verse is either a <strong>prophesy</strong> of something to come, or a <strong>fulfillment</strong> of a prophesy earlier in the Bible.

Since all of the text can be stored in a relational database it is efficient if a specific location can be represented by a simple number so that a relational query can be expressed as a simple range of numbers.   The Bible always contains a small number of books, and each book contains a reasonably small number of chapters, which in turn contain a reasonably small number of verses.  If we assume that all of these numbers are less than 1000, we can encode a location with the following formula:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Location = ( Book number * 1,000,000 ) + ( Chapter number * 1,000 ) + Verse number.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example the Great Commission beginning in Matthew 28:18 would be at location 40,028,018.    Genesis 2:3 would be 1,002,003.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since this concept of location occurs in a number of places in such an application, we could either code this math in all those places, or more efficiently and importantly we should create a new class called Location that would encapsulate this whole calculation and the other details in a single place.   All the other classes in the model would consume the services of the Location class.     This is an example of the way that object oriented design and coding helps greatly in reducing duplicated code, code fragility, and allows future flexibility.    If we applied this logic to another book or a library of books that is significantly larger than the Bible, we would only have to change one piece of code.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Object Design of a Bible Study Application.','','inherit','closed','closed','','627-revision-v1','','','2024-09-09 14:56:07','2024-09-09 14:56:07','',627,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=693',0,'revision','',0),

These translations have been done for around 2000 languages for the New Testament, or 1000 languages for the whole Bible.   The reason for using translations is so that each person can read a text written in their \"heart language\", the language that is usually the native language.      As a result, each Bible used today is a translation into a modern language.   Therefore, any particular Bible is associated with one of many well known translations.   My study Bible is of the New American Translation which was translated from the very best Hebrew and Greek manuscripts.  My father\'s childhood Bible is a King James (or Authorized version) which was translated mostly from the Latin translation of Saint Jerome.     20th century readers will find the King James rather difficult and olde fashioned.

The passage begins at a specific verse and ends with another specific verse.  Most printed study Bibles were written by a specific scholar.   But, there is usually not any specific annotations or notes indicating what that <strong>scholar</strong> thought about the reference.   I would like to be able to record that information, or write my own.   I would  also like to indicate the <strong>role</strong> that the reference plays.  Examples could be that the verse (or passage) is a <strong>direct quote</strong> from somewhere else, or it could be a <strong>parallel passage</strong> from one of the other gospels.   It could be that this verse is either a <strong>prophesy</strong> of something to come, or a <strong>fulfillment</strong> of a prophesy earlier in the Bible.

Since all of the text can be stored in a relational database it is efficient if a specific location can be represented by a simple number so that a relational query can be expressed as a simple range of numbers.   The Bible always contains a small number of books, and each book contains a reasonably small number of chapters, which in turn contain a reasonably small number of verses.  If we assume that all of these numbers are less than 1000, we can encode a location with the following formula:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Location = ( Book number * 1,000,000 ) + ( Chapter number * 1,000 ) + Verse number.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example the Great Commission beginning in Matthew 28:18 would be at location 40,028,018.    Genesis 2:3 would be 1,002,003.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since this concept of location occurs in a number of places in such an application, we could either code this math in all those places, or more efficiently and importantly we should create a new class called Location that would encapsulate this whole calculation and the other details in a single place.   All the other classes in the model would consume the services of the Location class.     This is an example of the way that object oriented design and coding helps greatly in reducing duplicated code, code fragility, and allows future flexibility.    If we applied this logic to another book or a library of books that is significantly larger than the Bible, we would only have to change one piece of code.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Object Design of a Bible Study Application.','','inherit','closed','closed','','627-revision-v1','','','2024-09-09 15:02:04','2024-09-09 15:02:04','',627,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=695',0,'revision','',0),

The reason for using translations is so that each person can read a text written in their \"heart language\", the language that is usually the native language. As a result, each Bible used today is a translation into a modern language. Therefore, any particular Bible is associated with one of many well known translations. My study Bible is of the <strong>New American Standard Bible (NASB) </strong>translation which was translated from the very best Hebrew and Greek manuscripts. My father\'s childhood Bible is a<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong> (or Authorized version) which was translated mostly from the Latin translation of Saint Jerome. 20th century readers will find the King James rather difficult and olde fashioned.

Since all of the text can be stored in a relational database it is efficient if a specific location can be represented by a simple number so that a relational query can be expressed as a simple range of numbers.   The Bible always contains a small number of books, and each book contains a reasonably small number of chapters, which in turn contain a reasonably small number of verses.  If we assume that all of these numbers are less than 1000, we can encode a location with the following formula:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Location = ( Book number * 1,000,000 ) + ( Chapter number * 1,000 ) + Verse number.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example the Great Commission beginning in Matthew 28:18 would be at location 40,028,018.    Genesis 2:3 would be 1,002,003.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since this concept of location occurs in a number of places in such an application, we could either code this math in all those places, or more efficiently and importantly we should create a new class called Location that would encapsulate this whole calculation and the other details in a single place.   All the other classes in the model would consume the services of the Location class.     This is an example of the way that object oriented design and coding helps greatly in reducing duplicated code, code fragility, and allows future flexibility.    If we applied this logic to another book or a library of books that is significantly larger than the Bible, we would only have to change one piece of code.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Object Design of a Bible Study Application.','','inherit','closed','closed','','627-revision-v1','','','2024-09-09 15:11:59','2024-09-09 15:11:59','',627,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=697',0,'revision','',0),

The reason for using translations is so that each person can read a text written in their \"heart language\", the language that is usually the native language. As a result, each Bible used today is a translation into a modern language. Therefore, any particular Bible is associated with one of many well known translations. My study Bible is of the <strong>New American Standard Bible (NASB) </strong>translation which was translated from the very best Hebrew and Greek manuscripts. My father\'s childhood Bible is a<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong> (or Authorized version) which was translated mostly from the Latin translation of Saint Jerome. 20th century readers will find the King James rather difficult and olde fashioned.

But, there is usually not any specific annotations or notes indicating what that <strong>scholar</strong> thought about the reference. I would like to be able to record that information, or write my own. I would also like to indicate the <strong>role</strong> that the reference plays. Examples could be that the verse (or passage) is a <strong>direct quote</strong> from somewhere else, or it could be a <strong>parallel passage</strong> from one of the other gospels. It could be that this verse is either a <strong>prophesy</strong> of something to come, or a <strong>fulfillment</strong> of a prophesy earlier in the Bible.

Since all of the text can be stored in a relational database it is efficient if a specific location can be represented by a simple number so that a relational query can be expressed as a simple range of numbers.   The Bible always contains a small number of books, and each book contains a reasonably small number of chapters, which in turn contain a reasonably small number of verses.  If we assume that all of these numbers are less than 1000, we can encode a location with the following formula:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Location = ( Book number * 1,000,000 ) + ( Chapter number * 1,000 ) + Verse number.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example the Great Commission beginning in Matthew 28:18 would be at location 40,028,018.    Genesis 2:3 would be 1,002,003.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since this concept of location occurs in a number of places in such an application, we could either code this math in all those places, or more efficiently and importantly we should create a new class called Location that would encapsulate this whole calculation and the other details in a single place.   All the other classes in the model would consume the services of the Location class.     This is an example of the way that object oriented design and coding helps greatly in reducing duplicated code, code fragility, and allows future flexibility.    If we applied this logic to another book or a library of books that is significantly larger than the Bible, we would only have to change one piece of code.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Object Design of a Bible Study Application.','','inherit','closed','closed','','627-revision-v1','','','2024-09-09 20:54:27','2024-09-09 20:54:27','',627,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=701',0,'revision','',0),

The reason for using translations is so that each person can read a text written in their \"heart language\", the language that is usually the native language. As a result, each Bible used today is a translation into a modern language. Therefore, any particular Bible is associated with one of many well known translations. My study Bible is of the <strong>New American Standard Bible (NASB) </strong>translation which was translated from the very best Hebrew and Greek manuscripts. My father\'s childhood Bible is a<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong> (or Authorized version) which was translated mostly from the Latin translation of Saint Jerome. 20th century readers will find the King James rather difficult and olde fashioned.

Since all of the text can be stored in a relational database it is efficient if a specific location can be represented by a simple number so that a relational query can be expressed as a simple range of numbers.   The Bible always contains a small number of books, and each book contains a reasonably small number of chapters, which in turn contain a reasonably small number of verses.  If we assume that all of these numbers are less than 1000, we can encode a location with the following formula:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Location = ( Book number * 1,000,000 ) + ( Chapter number * 1,000 ) + Verse number.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example the Great Commission beginning in Matthew 28:18 would be at location 40,028,018.    Genesis 2:3 would be 1,002,003.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since this concept of location occurs in a number of places in such an application, we could either code this math in all those places, or more efficiently and importantly we should create a new class called Location that would encapsulate this whole calculation and the other details in a single place.   All the other classes in the model would consume the services of the Location class.     This is an example of the way that object oriented design and coding helps greatly in reducing duplicated code, code fragility, and allows future flexibility.    If we applied this logic to another book or a library of books that is significantly larger than the Bible, we would only have to change one piece of code.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Object Design of a Bible Study Application.','','inherit','closed','closed','','627-revision-v1','','','2024-09-09 21:08:35','2024-09-09 21:08:35','',627,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=702',0,'revision','',0),

The reason for using translations is so that each person can read a text written in their \"heart language\", the language that is usually the native language. As a result, each Bible used today is a translation into a modern language. Therefore, any particular Bible is associated with one of many well known translations. My study Bible is of the <strong>New American Standard Bible (NASB) </strong>translation which was translated from the very best Hebrew and Greek manuscripts. My father\'s childhood Bible is a<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong> (or Authorized version) which was translated mostly from the Latin translation of Saint Jerome. 20th century readers will find the King James rather difficult and olde fashioned.

Since all of the text can be stored in a relational database it is efficient if a specific location can be represented by a simple number so that a relational query can be expressed as a simple range of numbers.   The Bible always contains a small number of books, and each book contains a reasonably small number of chapters, which in turn contain a reasonably small number of verses.  If we assume that all of these numbers are less than 1000, we can encode a location with the following formula:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Location = ( Book number * 1,000,000 ) + ( Chapter number * 1,000 ) + Verse number.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example the Great Commission beginning in Matthew 28:18 would be at location 40,028,018.    Genesis 2:3 would be 1,002,003.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since this concept of location occurs in a number of places in such an application, we could either code this math in all those places, or more efficiently and importantly we should create a new class called Location that would encapsulate this whole calculation and the other details in a single place.   All the other classes in the model would consume the services of the Location class.     This is an example of the way that object oriented design and coding helps greatly in reducing duplicated code, code fragility, and allows future flexibility.    If we applied this logic to another book or a library of books that is significantly larger than the Bible, we would only have to change one piece of code.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Implementations of the model</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I currently have these projects on going to implement this model in two different languages and implementations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/BibleModel\">MichaelKentBurns / BibleModel</a> - A Node.js Javascript implementation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/BibleModel-Pharo\">MichaelKentBurns / BibleModel-Pharo</a> - A Pharo Smalltalk implementation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Object Design of a Bible Study Application.','','inherit','closed','closed','','627-revision-v1','','','2024-09-09 21:15:12','2024-09-09 21:15:12','',627,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=703',0,'revision','',0),

For web developers that is usually HTML, CSS, and then later Javascript.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Their learning material is often learning sites such as <a href=\"https://www.frontendmentor.io/\"><strong>FrontEndMentor</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\"><strong>freeCodeCamp</strong></a>.   They may also refer to standards organizations documentation sites such as <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/\"><strong>W3Schools</strong></a>.    These are good approaches because the student is focused on learning and doing specific simple things that produce tangible results quickly.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This phase of learning will usually take months or years to learn enough to feel confident to be able to take on a large project or a full-time employment.   However, those challenges are much bigger than knowing how to do a lot of specific tasks.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the principles that I focus on teaching fairly early in my training is to start teaching the bigger picture issues little by little during this initial learning curve.  The reason I do this is so that the student has a larger long range conceptual picture of what is required to \"go pro\".   Examples of that are my pages on <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/work-globally/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"59\">Work Globally</a>\'</strong>, <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/working-in-a-professional-team/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"149\">Working in a team\'</a>,</strong> and \'<strong><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/finding-work/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"79\">Finding Work</a>\'</strong>.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This page on <strong>Software Design</strong> is another key big picture item that I think beginners need to start learning and embracing early in their development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the symptoms of a new developer that has not begun to learn software design is what I call the \'<strong>code snippet collection</strong>\'. When building a web page to fetch some data, massage it some, and present it in a table, the beginner takes each piece of the job and either recalls or googles for code snippets. Then they stack those together to get the specific job done. For larger projects they simply repeat that process as many times as necessary. This results in many problems, one of which is \'<strong>fragile code</strong>\'. Fragile code is code that breaks in unpredictable ways when something in the code itself or the environment or even code it depends on changes. For example, if your HTML calls some javascript code to import some data and your program needs to run in a different environment, you may have to change your code to use a different language syntax or call a different API that has a different calling sequence. When this happens you have to go to <strong>ALL</strong> of the places in your code that does that specific thing and change them all. If you don\'t get them all right your program is broken and you might not have tested all of those places. This can be an extremely time consuming process, and such tedious tasks often get sloppy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another problem is \'<strong>inconsistent behavior</strong>\'.   If you need to code something that is similar, but not identical to something you have done, you may end up getting a snippet that implements some action in a different way.   This will trip up your users and if you document your solution you will end up describing features and their exceptions.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These are just a few examples of issues that lead to project overruns, very expensive maintenance and customer dissatisfaction.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Solution: </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The biggest solution to those problems is to be able to easily understand the larger picture of the finished product, how it is built, and what is really required.  You can\'t do that by reading all of the code in a project.   You need a top down approach that teaches the big ideas and then works down to the details. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many large projects have failed because they attempted to write very detailed requirements and design documentation. It\'s easy to see how that approach worked out by simply reading the Wikipedia page on \'<strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">Waterfall Model</a></strong>\'. The retrospective motto of this way of working is \'<em><strong>If you are going to fail, you might as well fail BIG.</strong>\'</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I said above, software design should be learned incrementally and early. This means that the concepts and processes of design should start out as simple as possible and only get more complex as needed for the job at hand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Paradigm: Object-oriented programming:</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every person begins to learn the world around them as a collection of Objects. An object is simply a thing in the environment that is identifiable, has a set of identifiable properties, and a fairly consistent behavior. A toddler is crawling on the floor and encounters that family pet, the cat. The cat is cute, is furry, and has four legs. It makes a meow sound and likes to rub against things. It will play with things left on the floor. If you pull on its tail, sharp things come out of the legs and scratch or cut you. The family may have more than one cat and they are different sizes and colors, but they mostly behave the same. The dog however is a different animal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From our earliest days we encounter many different objects and learn to classify them and anticipate their properties.   As our world becomes more complex we simply develop more sophisticated understanding of objects and their classes.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The beauty of object-oriented languages is that their syntax can be extremely simple yet extremely intuitive.

UML is a very powerful visually oriented way of describing a design. I am a visual learner. For me a picture is worth way more than a thousand words. If I have to read a design description, I will get a piece of paper, and diagram what I am reading. With a diagram you can actually point your finger at things and trace their relationships to other things. There are people that can describe complex things in words in very vivid terms. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman\">Richard Feynman</a> is perhaps one of the best. He has a series of lectures to ordinary college classes in which he describes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics\">Quantum Mechanics</a> (which he was the major contributor to) in ways that make me say \"OH! I get it now.\". But, he was a very brilliant and gifted professor. Most engineers can\'t describe designs like that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I will describe UML more thoroughly shortly, but it is beyond what is needed to begin to understand software design at the beginning level.    Instead, I will begin with CRC cards.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design on a postcard:  CRC - Class Responsibility Collaborator</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<p>A precursor to the UML was an intentionally simplified method of describing the basics of Object-Oriented software design. <br /><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-responsibility-collaboration_card\">Wikipedia has a good page describing this </a>that should be required reading (Read it!).</p>\n<p>CRC cards were written on 3x5\" index cards during a design session. As the team discussed the design, whenever they determined they needed a new class they would grab a blank card and write the basics then put the card on the table. When a new card was introduced it would be laid next to the cards that it relates to, and its name was written on the \'collaborators\' section of those cards. As the team discussed the design they would rearrange the cards and talk their way through common usage scenarios.</p>\n<p>This is admittedly a very simple design process, but it proved to be very effective and low cost design method.</p>\n<p>There are simple web applications to create CRC cards, but that is usually more formal than necessary. ¬† I find that pen and paper works best. ¬†¬†</p>\n<p>Images of some CRC Cards and a CRC design.</p>\n<p>[gallery type=\"rectangular\" ids=\"615,616,617,618,619,620\"]</p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design by diagram:  Unified Modeling Language.</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<p>UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language\">Wikipedia describes the history of its development.</a></p>\n<p><strong>For full disclosure:</strong> <br />I am a HUGE proponent of the use of UML. I used it extensively during my career<br />at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_Institute\">SAS Institute</a>. I was one of the employees that was part of the origins of the formalized use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata\">metadata</a>. ¬† Metadata is a fancy term for information about data. ¬†One of the simplest forms of metadata is the filesystem on your computer. ¬†You create a directory called a Git repository. ¬†Inside the repository you create files. ¬†The files have names like README.md and index.html. ¬† The name tells you generally what it represents and the file extension tells you the language and the program needed to edit or present it (eg. .md for markdown, .html you can edit in a text program or a programming IDE, and you run it in a web browser. ¬† ¬†Other metadata is the date and time the file was modified, its size, and more. ¬†</p>\n<p>The original metadata database for SAS products was written for a single specific project. It was called the \"<strong>Metabase</strong>\" (Metadata database) written in a SAS proprietary object-oriented language called SCL (Screen Control Language). It was written by one guy while flat on his back in the hospital after back surgery. He knew the details of how data and programs were described in our products and wrote SCL code to model that. If the details changed he would have to go back into the SCL and modify it to match. ¬†Since this was a fairly simple model, that was not too much effort.</p>\n<p>However, when it was decided that all metadata for all SAS\' many products would be incorporated into a single metadata model, it was quite a huge task. ¬†See the <a href=\"https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/omamodref/67417/HTML/default/viewer.htm#hierlist.htm\">product documentation of the metadata model</a>. ¬†There are 172 different data types described. My team\'s job was to implement a metadata server that would provide access to the storage of all of that metadata for all <a href=\"https://support.sas.com/en/software/all-products-support.html\">300+ SAS products</a>. ¬†Those products were growing and changing constantly. ¬†To implement all of that by hand coding classes was a monstrous job that would have taken a large team years to implement and maintained.</p>\n<p>I thought there was a better way. I attended a software development conference called <strong>SD2000</strong> in San Jose, California (where I went to university). Several of the presenters were the pioneers in the latest software development methodologies and technologies. I took what I learned there and came back to work. I pitched the idea of using the UML language and the applications to build and manage the model<br />as a tool. One of our team members learned to used those modeling tools, and her job was to visit with the development teams for all SAS products. She learned what metadata they needed to to make their product work and built a standardized model that unified all metadata for all those products.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I wrote a program called ModelCompiler (in Java) which would read in that model from the tools and generate C source code to implement the model in the<br /><a href=\"https://support.sas.com/en/software/metadata-server-support.html\">metadata server that our team built</a>. ¬† That code was compiled and linked into our products so that they could access the server. ¬† By the way, the product documentation shown in the link above for the SAS metadata model is also generated using the UML model.</p>\n<p>Even though the most visible part of a UML model is the diagrams, the underlying model that describes all of those details is stored in a rich database. ¬† The diagrams are drawn automatically using drawing algorithms. ¬† There is also text and lists and lots of other representations. ¬† Since the model is a live database, it is possible to write programs that navigate through the details in that database and generate almost any kind of representation, including source code, and HTML diagrams.¬†</p>\n<h3>Examples of Object Oriented design and implementation:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/software-design/object-design-of-a-bible-study-application/\">A design and implementation of a program to read and deeply study the Bible.</a></li>\n</ul>','Software Design','','inherit','closed','closed','','609-revision-v1','','','2024-09-10 15:46:13','2024-09-10 15:46:13','',609,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=706',0,'revision','',0),

As you read, make note for each section, whether you already know that information well, what you know a little bit, and what sections are new to you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. In the areas you don‚Äôt know well, take some time to follow some of the many links provided. Don‚Äôt study them in detail, but read enough to see what is discussed and what you may want to revisit at a later date.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5. In the section about HTML and the Hello World page, take the time to actually try that for yourself. In the browser notice the address bar of your browser that the url uses the ‚Äò<a href=\"file://\'/\">file://\'</a>protocol.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>6. When you get to the HTTP section, read that closely to understand how visiting a we page via http:// is different from file://</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>7 When you are done with task 4, take the survey ‚Äòread-front-end-web -page‚Äô. You will be asked there to relate some of the notes you talk when reading this page.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8. Leave a comment at the bottom of the page and indicate something you learned on that page.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9.

Start your timekeeping as usual.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. In the introduction paragraphs make note of the two key differences between the Front end, and the Back end.  The differences have to do with the programs involved and where those programs run. Make sure you can briefly explain those differences.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. Read the wikipedia page on \'Frontend and backend\'. See if you can learn what \'client side\' and \'server side\' mean and which programs run in each.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. Read the wikipedia page on LAMP.  See if you can find the \'Stack\' concept in the illustrations and make a list of what is in the stack.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5. In the \'Key Components\' section notice some of the programming languages that can be used and identify which languages you already know something about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>6. Pay attention to the section on \'Frameworks\' and research one of those frameworks enough to know why it would be used.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>7. In the \'Essential Skills...\' section, note which of those skills you think you should begin learning, and why?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8. In the \'Common Tools and Technologies\' section, are there any tools you already know something about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9. In the \'Best Practices\' section, follow the link on \'Code Reviews\' and note two of the benefits of code reviews that would help you most at this time. You will be doing some code reviews with your mentor very soon.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>10. Take the survey named <strong>Read-backend</strong>, and finish your time accounting. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Task 6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read ‚ÄòFull stack‚Äô page.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. Start your timekeeping as usual.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2.  The Full stack page covers the concepts of front end and back end, but at a higher level.  This page emphasizes the expert level of knowledge needed to bring all of the front end and back end skills together to make a full web based application.   At your level of learning, you are not expected to gain this knowledge, but it is important that you are aware that someone has to put it all together.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. What the Full stack page does not yet tell you is the importance of security.  We are just now starting to explore security issues in the <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/security/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"583\">Security page</a> and some blog posts discussed there.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. Although this page leads to many other technologies to create full stack solutions, it also points out that for many purposes WordPress is a full stack solution that is open source and contains more advanced technologies that are available.  This is why I (Michael) chose WordPress to build this training site.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5. Spend some time on this page just to be familiar with it, and return to it later when you have advanced in both front end and back end development and are ready to take on more.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>6. Take the \'<strong>read-full-stack</strong>\' survey, then finish up your time keeping. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Task 7:&nbsp;&nbsp;Read ‚ÄòWork globally‚Äô page and take the two challenges it mentions.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You should now have taken challenges 1 through 4.

As you read, make note for each section, whether you already know that information well, what you know a little bit, and what sections are new to you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. In the areas you don‚Äôt know well, take some time to follow some of the many links provided.

Start your timekeeping as usual.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. In the introduction paragraphs make note of the two key differences between the Front end, and the Back end.  The differences have to do with the programs involved and where those programs run. Make sure you can briefly explain those differences.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. Read the wikipedia page on \'Frontend and backend\'. See if you can learn what \'client side\' and \'server side\' mean and which programs run in each.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. Read the wikipedia page on LAMP.  See if you can find the \'Stack\' concept in the illustrations and make a list of what is in the stack.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5. In the \'Key Components\' section notice some of the programming languages that can be used and identify which languages you already know something about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>6. Pay attention to the section on \'Frameworks\' and research one of those frameworks enough to know why it would be used.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>7. In the \'Essential Skills...\' section, note which of those skills you think you should begin learning, and why?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8.

Start your timekeeping as usual.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2.  The Full stack page covers the concepts of front end and back end, but at a higher level.  This page emphasizes the expert level of knowledge needed to bring all of the front end and back end skills together to make a full web based application.   At your level of learning, you are not expected to gain this knowledge, but it is important that you are aware that someone has to put it all together.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. What the Full stack page does not yet tell you is the importance of security.  We are just now starting to explore security issues in the <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/security/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"583\">Security page</a> and some blog posts discussed there.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. Although this page leads to many other technologies to create full stack solutions, it also points out that for many purposes WordPress is a full stack solution that is open source and contains more advanced technologies that are available.  This is why I (Michael) chose WordPress to build this training site.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5.

The visual style of his page is very cool and well layed out.  It has a pleasant but subdued graphic in the background with a clear and well balanced form in the center.   He has used some simple text entry fields, a multiple choice button group, a pulldown selector, a sequence of checkboxes and a larger text box for comments and suggestions.   He has coded value validation.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The primary purpose of this exercise is the use of GitHub projects.   His README.md file is thorough.   It has a small table of contents up front.  It describes the purpose of the project he is building, and a description of the process he is using to build the project.  He describes the tools and techniques he is using, and has a start of a list of the lessons he has learned so far in the project.     </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He is using the Issues list feature of the project to list the 13 major steps in his process so far.

This page emphasizes the expert level of knowledge needed to bring all of the front end and back end skills together to make a full web based application.   At your level of learning, you are not expected to gain this knowledge, but it is important that you are aware that someone has to put it all together.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3.

One thing I like about his project is that it has an immediate application of organizing the efforts of other volunteers in the media group at his church.   The visual style of his page is very cool and well layed out.  It has a pleasant but subdued graphic in the background with a clear and well balanced form in the center.   He has used some simple text entry fields, a multiple choice button group, a pulldown selector, a sequence of checkboxes and a larger text box for comments and suggestions.   He has coded value validation.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The primary purpose of this exercise is the use of GitHub projects.   His README.md file is thorough.   It has a small table of contents up front.  It describes the purpose of the project he is building, and a description of the process he is using to build the project.  He describes the tools and techniques he is using, and has a start of a list of the lessons he has learned so far in the project.     </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He is using the Issues list feature of the project to list the 13 major steps in his process so far.  Each issue has a short description, and he is including the issue number and a short description of each of the 18 commits.   This helps me as a reviewer to quickly understand the intent, design, and process as well as what each commit contained.     <strong>Well done Gauthier!</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Samuel Bulangalizi</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":709,\"width\":\"345px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3765-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-709\" style=\"width:345px;height:auto\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Samuel\'s</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Samuel11s/My-first-tutorial-project\">project for Task 7 </a> has a nice README.md file.   He describes his objectives, the features of the page,  the technology he will use to achieve it.  He describes the process he will follow with a rough schedule.   In his list of requirements the first is to learn basic Javascript.   This was a problem in his plan to build this page because Javascript is a lot to learn.    This is a worthwhile endeavor but it will delay the completion of his project.   He has done well in using the Issues feature of GitHub.  There are 6 closed issues, four of which he created and two of which I added.   These 6 he has completed and closed them.   There are 3 issues remaining, one of which is learning Javascript.    When I review the 11 commits he has made to his code I notice that he has entered good descriptions which allows me as a reviewer to know what the commit was for without having to open each to understand.   <strong>The main point of this task </strong>was to learn how to use the features of a GitHub project to complete a project and I think Samuel has done a fine job of demonstrating that knowledge.   From what he has coded already I can see that he knows how to design and layout a page well.  Well done Samuel, you have learned this lesson and I\'m confident that you will complete your project when you have learned the required Javascript. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Salomon Mwilo</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":710,\"width\":\"382px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PXL_20240905_095856292.SK-I-901x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-710\" style=\"width:382px;height:auto\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Achiza Masirika Th√©ophile</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":711,\"width\":\"450px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PXL_20240422_1509557552-1024x748.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-711\" style=\"width:450px;height:auto\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You are not alone in this.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You will be engaging not only the material, but you will have a <strong>mentor</strong> who has been through the course.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For this course, we anticipate this pairing:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Efatha will mentor Salomon</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Philemon will mentor Gauthier</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Ashuza will mentor Samuel</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>And Michael will mentor Theophile.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Starting Course</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The starting course is designed to familiarize the student with the training website and the people and processes involved.

You can see it yourself on GitOne thing I like about his project is that it has an immediate application of organizing the efforts of other volunteers in the media group at his church. The visual style of his page is very cool and well layed out. It has a pleasant but subdued graphic in the background with a clear and well balanced form in the center. He has used some simple text entry fields, a multiple choice button group, a pulldown selector, a sequence of checkboxes and a larger text box for comments and suggestions. He has coded value validation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The primary purpose of this exercise is the use of GitHub projects.   His README.md file is thorough.   It has a small table of contents up front.  It describes the purpose of the project he is building, and a description of the process he is using to build the project.  He describes the tools and techniques he is using, and has a start of a list of the lessons he has learned so far in the project.     </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He is using the Issues list feature of the project to list the 13 major steps in his process so far.  Each issue has a short description, and he is including the issue number and a short description of each of the 18 commits.   This helps me as a reviewer to quickly understand the intent, design, and process as well as what each commit contained.     <strong>Well done Gauthier!</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Samuel Bulangalizi</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":709,\"width\":\"345px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3765-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-709\" style=\"width:345px;height:auto\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Samuel\'s</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Samuel11s/My-first-tutorial-project\">project for Task 7 </a> has a nice README.md file.   He describes his objectives, the features of the page,  the technology he will use to achieve it.  He describes the process he will follow with a rough schedule.   In his list of requirements the first is to learn basic Javascript.   This was a problem in his plan to build this page because Javascript is a lot to learn.    This is a worthwhile endeavor but it will delay the completion of his project.   He has done well in using the Issues feature of GitHub.  There are 6 closed issues, four of which he created and two of which I added.   These 6 he has completed and closed them.   There are 3 issues remaining, one of which is learning Javascript.    When I review the 11 commits he has made to his code I notice that he has entered good descriptions which allows me as a reviewer to know what the commit was for without having to open each to understand.   <strong>The main point of this task </strong>was to learn how to use the features of a GitHub project to complete a project and I think Samuel has done a fine job of demonstrating that knowledge.   From what he has coded already I can see that he knows how to design and layout a page well.  Well done Samuel, you have learned this lesson and I\'m confident that you will complete your project when you have learned the required Javascript. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Salomon Mwilo</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":710,\"width\":\"382px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PXL_20240905_095856292.SK-I-901x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-710\" style=\"width:382px;height:auto\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Salomon\'s</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Salomonmwilo/My-first-tutorial-project\">project for Task 7</a> shows good progress already.

One thing I like about his project is that it has an immediate application of organizing the efforts of other volunteers in the media group at his church.   The visual style of his page is very cool and well layed out.  It has a pleasant but subdued graphic in the background with a clear and well balanced form in the center.   He has used some simple text entry fields, a multiple choice button group, a pulldown selector, a sequence of checkboxes and a larger text box for comments and suggestions.   He has coded value validation.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The primary purpose of this exercise is the use of GitHub projects.   His README.md file is thorough.   It has a small table of contents up front.  It describes the purpose of the project he is building, and a description of the process he is using to build the project.  He describes the tools and techniques he is using, and has a start of a list of the lessons he has learned so far in the project.     </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He is using the Issues list feature of the project to list the 13 major steps in his process so far.  Each issue has a short description, and he is including the issue number and a short description of each of the 18 commits.   This helps me as a reviewer to quickly understand the intent, design, and process as well as what each commit contained.     <strong>Well done Gauthier!</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Samuel Bulangalizi</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":709,\"width\":\"345px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3765-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-709\" style=\"width:345px;height:auto\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Samuel\'s</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Samuel11s/My-first-tutorial-project\">project for Task 7 </a> has a nice README.md file.   He describes his objectives, the features of the page,  the technology he will use to achieve it.  He describes the process he will follow with a rough schedule.   In his list of requirements the first is to learn basic Javascript.   This was a problem in his plan to build this page because Javascript is a lot to learn.    This is a worthwhile endeavor but it will delay the completion of his project.   He has done well in using the Issues feature of GitHub.  There are 6 closed issues, four of which he created and two of which I added.   These 6 he has completed and closed them.   There are 3 issues remaining, one of which is learning Javascript.    When I review the 11 commits he has made to his code I notice that he has entered good descriptions which allows me as a reviewer to know what the commit was for without having to open each to understand.   <strong>The main point of this task </strong>was to learn how to use the features of a GitHub project to complete a project and I think Samuel has done a fine job of demonstrating that knowledge.   From what he has coded already I can see that he knows how to design and layout a page well.  Well done Samuel, you have learned this lesson and I\'m confident that you will complete your project when you have learned the required Javascript. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Salomon Mwilo</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":710,\"width\":\"382px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PXL_20240905_095856292.SK-I-901x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-710\" style=\"width:382px;height:auto\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Salomon\'s</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Salomonmwilo/My-first-tutorial-project\">project for Task 7</a> shows good progress already.

He has coded value validation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The primary purpose of this exercise is the use of GitHub projects.   His README.md file is thorough.   It has a small table of contents up front.  It describes the purpose of the project he is building, and a description of the process he is using to build the project.  He describes the tools and techniques he is using, and has a start of a list of the lessons he has learned so far in the project.     </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He is using the Issues list feature of the project to list the 13 major steps in his process so far.  Each issue has a short description, and he is including the issue number and a short description of each of the 18 commits.   This helps me as a reviewer to quickly understand the intent, design, and process as well as what each commit contained.     <strong>Well done Gauthier!</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Samuel Bulangalizi</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":709,\"width\":\"345px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3765-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-709\" style=\"width:345px;height:auto\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Samuel\'s</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Samuel11s/My-first-tutorial-project\">project for Task 7 </a> has a nice README.md file.   He describes his objectives, the features of the page,  the technology he will use to achieve it.  He describes the process he will follow with a rough schedule.   In his list of requirements the first is to learn basic Javascript.   This was a problem in his plan to build this page because Javascript is a lot to learn.    This is a worthwhile endeavor but it will delay the completion of his project.   He has done well in using the Issues feature of GitHub.  There are 6 closed issues, four of which he created and two of which I added.   These 6 he has completed and closed them.   There are 3 issues remaining, one of which is learning Javascript.    When I review the 11 commits he has made to his code I notice that he has entered good descriptions which allows me as a reviewer to know what the commit was for without having to open each to understand.   <strong>The main point of this task </strong>was to learn how to use the features of a GitHub project to complete a project and I think Samuel has done a fine job of demonstrating that knowledge.   From what he has coded already I can see that he knows how to design and layout a page well.  Well done Samuel, you have learned this lesson and I\'m confident that you will complete your project when you have learned the required Javascript. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Salomon Mwilo</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":710,\"width\":\"382px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PXL_20240905_095856292.SK-I-901x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-710\" style=\"width:382px;height:auto\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Salomon\'s</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Salomonmwilo/My-first-tutorial-project\">project for Task 7</a> shows good progress already.

For web developers that is usually HTML, CSS, and then later Javascript.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Their learning material is often learning sites such as <a href=\"https://www.frontendmentor.io/\"><strong>FrontEndMentor</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\"><strong>freeCodeCamp</strong></a>.   They may also refer to standards organizations documentation sites such as <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/\"><strong>W3Schools</strong></a>.    These are good approaches because the student is focused on learning and doing specific simple things that produce tangible results quickly.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This phase of learning will usually take months or years to learn enough to feel confident to be able to take on a large project or a full-time employment.   However, those challenges are much bigger than knowing how to do a lot of specific tasks.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the principles that I focus on teaching fairly early in my training is to start teaching the bigger picture issues little by little during this initial learning curve.  The reason I do this is so that the student has a larger long range conceptual picture of what is required to \"go pro\".   Examples of that are my pages on <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/work-globally/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"59\">Work Globally</a>\'</strong>, <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/working-in-a-professional-team/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"149\">Working in a team\'</a>,</strong> and \'<strong><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/finding-work/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"79\">Finding Work</a>\'</strong>.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This page on <strong>Software Design</strong> is another key big picture item that I think beginners need to start learning and embracing early in their development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the symptoms of a new developer that has not begun to learn software design is what I call the \'<strong>code snippet collection</strong>\'. When building a web page to fetch some data, massage it some, and present it in a table, the beginner takes each piece of the job and either recalls or googles for code snippets. Then they stack those together to get the specific job done. For larger projects they simply repeat that process as many times as necessary. This results in many problems, one of which is \'<strong>fragile code</strong>\'. Fragile code is code that breaks in unpredictable ways when something in the code itself or the environment or even code it depends on changes. For example, if your HTML calls some javascript code to import some data and your program needs to run in a different environment, you may have to change your code to use a different language syntax or call a different API that has a different calling sequence. When this happens you have to go to <strong>ALL</strong> of the places in your code that does that specific thing and change them all. If you don\'t get them all right your program is broken and you might not have tested all of those places. This can be an extremely time consuming process, and such tedious tasks often get sloppy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another problem is \'<strong>inconsistent behavior</strong>\'.   If you need to code something that is similar, but not identical to something you have done, you may end up getting a snippet that implements some action in a different way.   This will trip up your users and if you document your solution you will end up describing features and their exceptions.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These are just a few examples of issues that lead to project overruns, very expensive maintenance and customer dissatisfaction.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Solution: </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The biggest solution to those problems is to be able to easily understand the larger picture of the finished product, how it is built, and what is really required.  You can\'t do that by reading all of the code in a project.   You need a top down approach that teaches the big ideas and then works down to the details. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many large projects have failed because they attempted to write very detailed requirements and design documentation. It\'s easy to see how that approach worked out by simply reading the Wikipedia page on \'<strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">Waterfall Model</a></strong>\'. The retrospective motto of this way of working is \'<em><strong>If you are going to fail, you might as well fail BIG.</strong>\'</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I said above, software design should be learned incrementally and early.

It was called the \"<strong>Metabase</strong>\" (Metadata database) written in a SAS proprietary object-oriented language called SCL (Screen Control Language). It was written by one guy while flat on his back in the hospital after back surgery. He knew the details of how data and programs were described in our products and wrote SCL code to model that. If the details changed he would have to go back into the SCL and modify it to match. ¬†Since this was a fairly simple model, that was not too much effort.</p>\n<p>However, when it was decided that all metadata for all SAS\' many products would be incorporated into a single metadata model, it was quite a huge task. ¬†See the <a href=\"https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/omamodref/67417/HTML/default/viewer.htm#hierlist.htm\">product documentation of the metadata model</a>. ¬†There are 172 different data types described. My team\'s job was to implement a metadata server that would provide access to the storage of all of that metadata for all <a href=\"https://support.sas.com/en/software/all-products-support.html\">300+ SAS products</a>. ¬†Those products were growing and changing constantly. ¬†To implement all of that by hand coding classes was a monstrous job that would have taken a large team years to implement and maintained.</p>\n<p>I thought there was a better way. I attended a software development conference called <strong>SD2000</strong> in San Jose, California (where I went to university). Several of the presenters were the pioneers in the latest software development methodologies and technologies. I took what I learned there and came back to work. I pitched the idea of using the UML language and the applications to build and manage the model<br />as a tool. One of our team members learned to used those modeling tools, and her job was to visit with the development teams for all SAS products. She learned what metadata they needed to to make their product work and built a standardized model that unified all metadata for all those products.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I wrote a program called ModelCompiler (in Java) which would read in that model from the tools and generate C source code to implement the model in the<br /><a href=\"https://support.sas.com/en/software/metadata-server-support.html\">metadata server that our team built</a>. ¬† That code was compiled and linked into our products so that they could access the server. ¬† By the way, the product documentation shown in the link above for the SAS metadata model is also generated using the UML model.</p>\n<p>Even though the most visible part of a UML model is the diagrams, the underlying model that describes all of those details is stored in a rich database. ¬† The diagrams are drawn automatically using drawing algorithms. ¬† There is also text and lists and lots of other representations. ¬† Since the model is a live database, it is possible to write programs that navigate through the details in that database and generate almost any kind of representation, including source code, and HTML diagrams.¬†</p>\n<h3>Examples of Object Oriented design and implementation:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/software-design/object-design-of-a-bible-study-application/\">A design and implementation of a program to read and deeply study the Bible.</a></li>\n</ul>','Software Design','','inherit','closed','closed','','609-revision-v1','','','2024-10-12 14:27:57','2024-10-12 14:27:57','',609,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=724',0,'revision','',0),

For web developers that is usually HTML, CSS, and then later Javascript.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Their learning material is often learning sites such as <a href=\"https://www.frontendmentor.io/\"><strong>FrontEndMentor</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\"><strong>freeCodeCamp</strong></a>.   They may also refer to standards organizations documentation sites such as <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/\"><strong>W3Schools</strong></a>.    These are good approaches because the student is focused on learning and doing specific simple things that produce tangible results quickly.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This phase of learning will usually take months or years to learn enough to feel confident to be able to take on a large project or a full-time employment.   However, those challenges are much bigger than knowing how to do a lot of specific tasks.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the principles that I focus on teaching fairly early in my training is to start teaching the bigger picture issues little by little during this initial learning curve.  The reason I do this is so that the student has a larger long range conceptual picture of what is required to \"go pro\".   Examples of that are my pages on <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/work-globally/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"59\">Work Globally</a>\'</strong>, <strong>\'<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/working-in-a-professional-team/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"149\">Working in a team\'</a>,</strong> and \'<strong><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/finding-work/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"79\">Finding Work</a>\'</strong>.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This page on <strong>Software Design</strong> is another key big picture item that I think beginners need to start learning and embracing early in their development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the symptoms of a new developer that has not begun to learn software design is what I call the \'<strong>code snippet collection</strong>\'. When building a web page to fetch some data, massage it some, and present it in a table, the beginner takes each piece of the job and either recalls or googles for code snippets. Then they stack those together to get the specific job done. For larger projects they simply repeat that process as many times as necessary. This results in many problems, one of which is \'<strong>fragile code</strong>\'. Fragile code is code that breaks in unpredictable ways when something in the code itself or the environment or even code it depends on changes. For example, if your HTML calls some javascript code to import some data and your program needs to run in a different environment, you may have to change your code to use a different language syntax or call a different API that has a different calling sequence. When this happens you have to go to <strong>ALL</strong> of the places in your code that does that specific thing and change them all. If you don\'t get them all right your program is broken and you might not have tested all of those places. This can be an extremely time consuming process, and such tedious tasks often get sloppy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another problem is \'<strong>inconsistent behavior</strong>\'.   If you need to code something that is similar, but not identical to something you have done, you may end up getting a snippet that implements some action in a different way.   This will trip up your users and if you document your solution you will end up describing features and their exceptions.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These are just a few examples of issues that lead to project overruns, very expensive maintenance and customer dissatisfaction.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Solution: </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The biggest solution to those problems is to be able to easily understand the larger picture of the finished product, how it is built, and what is really required.  You can\'t do that by reading all of the code in a project.   You need a top down approach that teaches the big ideas and then works down to the details. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many large projects have failed because they attempted to write very detailed requirements and design documentation. It\'s easy to see how that approach worked out by simply reading the Wikipedia page on \'<strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">Waterfall Model</a></strong>\'. The retrospective motto of this way of working is \'<em><strong>If you are going to fail, you might as well fail BIG.</strong>\'</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I said above, software design should be learned incrementally and early.

These <strong>translations</strong> have been done for around 2000 languages for the New Testament, or 1000 languages for the whole Bible. The reason for using translations is so that each person can read a text written in their \"<a href=\"https://www.jesusfilm.org/blog/heart-language/\">heart language</a>\", the language that is usually the native language. As a result, each Bible used today is a translation into a modern language. Therefore, any particular Bible is associated with one of many well known translations. My study Bible is of the <strong>New American Standard Bible (NASB) </strong>translation which was translated from the very best Hebrew and Greek manuscripts. My father\'s childhood Bible is a<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong> (or Authorized version) which was translated mostly from the Latin translation of Saint Jerome. 20th century readers will find the King James rather difficult and olde fashioned.

Since all of the text can be stored in a relational database it is efficient if a specific location can be represented by a simple number so that a relational query can be expressed as a simple range of numbers.   The Bible always contains a small number of books, and each book contains a reasonably small number of chapters, which in turn contain a reasonably small number of verses.  If we assume that all of these numbers are less than 1000, we can encode a location with the following formula:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Location = ( Book number * 1,000,000 ) + ( Chapter number * 1,000 ) + Verse number.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example the Great Commission beginning in Matthew 28:18 would be at location 40,028,018.    Genesis 2:3 would be 1,002,003.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since this concept of location occurs in a number of places in such an application, we could either code this math in all those places, or more efficiently and importantly we should create a new class called Location that would encapsulate this whole calculation and the other details in a single place.

The Lord\'s Prayer is Matthew 6:9-13. The Sermon on the Mount is Matthew chapters 5-7. This type of collection can be referred to as a <strong>Passage</strong>. Sometimes a study <strong>Bible</strong> will have a scholar\'s provided title to describe the content or meaning of the <strong>passage</strong>.

Those are referred to as <strong>Cross References</strong>. They are printed in the margins next to the verse they originate at. I call that the <strong>Anchor Verse.</strong> The other end of the reference can be a single <strong>verse</strong> or a <strong>passage</strong>. Finally, scholars have supplied many <strong>footnotes</strong> that explain details that the average reader might not know regarding a verse. These are printed like <strong>footnotes</strong> in other books, except that rather than including a <strong>footnote</strong> number in square brackets, the <strong>footnotes</strong> are annotated to refer to the <strong>verse</strong> they describe.

These <strong>translations</strong> have been done for around 2000 languages for the New Testament, or 1000 languages for the whole Bible. The reason for using translations is so that each person can read a text written in their \"<a href=\"https://www.jesusfilm.org/blog/heart-language/\">heart language</a>\", the language that is usually the native language. As a result, each Bible used today is a translation into a modern language. Therefore, any particular Bible is associated with one of many well known translations. My study Bible is of the <strong>New American Standard Bible (NASB) </strong>translation which was translated from the very best Hebrew and Greek manuscripts. My father\'s childhood Bible is a<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong> (or Authorized version) which was translated mostly from the Latin translation of Saint Jerome. 20th century readers will find the King James rather difficult and olde fashioned. I present those two Bibles showing one of the most well known passages (John 3:16).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"imageCrop\":false,\"linkTo\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default\"><!-- wp:image {\"id\":700,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3747-2-1024x839.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-700\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":642,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3748-1024x903.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-642\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image --></figure>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With those concepts and terms, here is a CRC card that expresses the basic classes of objects:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":664,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3751-1-1024x606.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-664\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From real world object model to software object model</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ideally, the software object model should closely resemble the real world model at the highest level.

I would like to be able to record that information, or write my own. I would also like to indicate the <strong>role</strong> that the reference plays. Examples could be that the verse (or passage) is a <strong>direct quote</strong> from somewhere else, or it could be a <strong>parallel passage</strong> from one of the other gospels. It could be that this verse is either a <strong>prophesy</strong> of something to come, or a <strong>fulfillment</strong> of a prophesy earlier in the Bible.

Since all of the text can be stored in a relational database it is efficient if a specific location can be represented by a simple number so that a relational query can be expressed as a simple range of numbers.   The Bible always contains a small number of books, and each book contains a reasonably small number of chapters, which in turn contain a reasonably small number of verses.  If we assume that all of these numbers are less than 1000, we can encode a location with the following formula:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Location = ( Book number * 1,000,000 ) + ( Chapter number * 1,000 ) + Verse number.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example the Great Commission beginning in Matthew 28:18 would be at location 40,028,018.    Genesis 2:3 would be 1,002,003.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since this concept of location occurs in a number of places in such an application, we could either code this math in all those places, or more efficiently and importantly we should create a new class called Location that would encapsulate this whole calculation and the other details in a single place.   All the other classes in the model would consume the services of the Location class.     This is an example of the way that object oriented design and coding helps greatly in reducing duplicated code, code fragility, and allows future flexibility.    If we applied this logic to another book or a library of books that is significantly larger than the Bible, we would only have to change one piece of code.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Implementations of the model</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I currently have these projects on going to implement this model in two different languages and implementations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/BibleModel\">MichaelKentBurns / BibleModel</a> - A Node.js JavaScript implementation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/BibleModel-Pharo\">MichaelKentBurns / BibleModel-Pharo</a> - A Pharo Smalltalk implementation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Object Design of a Bible Study Application.','','inherit','closed','closed','','627-revision-v1','','','2024-12-10 22:55:47','2024-12-10 22:55:47','',627,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=739',0,'revision','',0),
