While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale. If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent. Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish. The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only. A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives. If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one. A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database.

One thing certainly is multitasking. It is rare that a single person, using their browser to view a web page, is the only user at that specific site. The back end is run on a more powerful machine that can server up web pages to many users around the world at the same time.

As an example look at <strong><a href=\"https://www.frontendmentor.io\">Frontend Mentor.</a></strong>  It is a good practice to capture your work for each challenge in a GitHub repository.  While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional about utilizing the features of Git.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you begin a challenge, you should create a GitHub repository and do all of your work step by step capturing your work as you go.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are ready to try that, go to<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/challenge-capture-a-tutorial-project-in-a-github-repository/\"> the challenge page</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to update the ReadMe file in the repository.

You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.

While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional in utilizing the features of Git.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you begin a challenge, you should </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Create a new repository to house it.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Download the initial codebase provided, and push that to GitHub as your starting point.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Take the first step in the challenge, then test it, and finally push that work.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Test all the features you have done so far during the challenge.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>If you find a bug or perhaps a new feature or enhancement, stop and create an issue in the repository.   You don\'t have to fix it immediately, but it is very important to record the issue and steps to reproduce it.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Continue your work stepwise capturing each step by pushing it with a descriptive comment.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Finally, or during the course of your work, look at the outstanding issues and pick one or two to address.  As each is fixed push the fix and close the issue. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to create a ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, update your resum√©, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create a project with other developers.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you learn with your friends take the opportunity to propose an original project that you all can work on together.   Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.   This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about. </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resum√© or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Work globally...','','inherit','closed','closed','','59-revision-v1','','','2023-04-03 21:31:38','2023-04-03 21:31:38','',59,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=75',0,'revision','',0),

You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resum√© or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Work globally...','','inherit','closed','closed','','59-revision-v1','','','2024-02-09 23:07:35','2024-02-09 23:07:35','',59,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=148',0,'revision','',0),

You don\'t have to fix it immediately, but it is very important to record the issue and steps to reproduce it.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Continue your work stepwise capturing each step by pushing it with a descriptive comment.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Finally, or during the course of your work, look at the outstanding issues and pick one or two to address.  As each is fixed push the fix and close the issue. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to create a ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, update your resum√©, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create a project with other developers.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you learn with your friends take the opportunity to propose an original project that you all can work on together.   Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.   This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about it. </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resum√© or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Work globally','','inherit','closed','closed','','59-revision-v1','','','2024-02-10 23:38:34','2024-02-10 23:38:34','',59,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=164',0,'revision','',0),

Each account can contain a number of repositories, which can be made public or private access.   A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer\'s personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.   As work progresses on the local machine and certain testable milestones are reached, the local changes can be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To get an idea of how this looks visit <a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns\">my GitHub account.</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.   Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/?page_id=59\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"59\">Learn more...</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Building your brand</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/building-your-brand/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"76\">Learn more...</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding work</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are a number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer\">freelance</a> marketplaces online.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/\">Upwork</a> is one we recommend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/finding-work/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"79\">Learn more...</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Latest Posts</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:latest-posts {\"align\":\"center\"} /-->','Home','','inherit','closed','closed','','2-revision-v1','','','2024-02-15 17:58:55','2024-02-15 17:58:55','',2,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=174',0,'revision','',0),

You can download that from this link now and install it.

As an example look at <strong><a href=\"https://www.frontendmentor.io\">Frontend Mentor.</a></strong>  This site is helpfully setup to capture your work for each challenge in a GitHub repository.  While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional in utilizing the features of Git.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you begin a challenge, you should create a GitHub repository and do all of your work step by step capturing your work as you go.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are ready to try that, go to the challenge page </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Create a new repository to house it.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Download the initial codebase provided, and push that to GitHub as your starting point.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Take the first step in the challenge, then test it, and finally push that work.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Test all the features you have done so far during the challenge.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>If you find a bug or perhaps a new feature or enhancement, stop and create an issue in the repository.   You don\'t have to fix it immediately, but it is very important to record the issue and steps to reproduce it.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Continue your work stepwise capturing each step by pushing it with a descriptive comment.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Finally, or during the course of your work, look at the outstanding issues and pick one or two to address.  As each is fixed push the fix and close the issue. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to create a ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, update your resum√©, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create a project with other developers.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you learn with your friends take the opportunity to propose an original project that you all can work on together.   Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.   This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about it. </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resum√© or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Work globally','','inherit','closed','closed','','59-revision-v1','','','2024-02-15 22:07:48','2024-02-15 22:07:48','',59,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=197',0,'revision','',0),

It consists of the text to be presented interspersed with HTML markup tags that specify how that text should be displayed.   The filename usually ends in either .htm or .html to indicated that it can be displayed in a web browser.  The HTML markup standards have been around since the beginning of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web\">World Wide Web.</a>  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTML5</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5\">HTML5</a> is simply the 5th major revision of the HTML standards that added significant modern features that make some web pages very dynamic. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS\">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics.   While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale.   If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent.  Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish.   The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only.   A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives.   If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one.    A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database.  But, that is another subject for another day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript - A procedural programming language for web pages.</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript\">JavaScript</a> is a programming language inspired by Java that is meant to run inside a web page.   All of the actual work is performed by the web browser itself. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As discussed above, all of the above technologies can run on any computer with a web browser.  The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer.   You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive.  Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then using your file browser (Windows explorer or Mac Finder) to locate that file and open it as you would any other document. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, that is all that is needed.  However, that does not make any use of the internet or the World Wide Web.   The \"World Wide\" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=\"http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm\">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.   The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol.

Try it yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific page (HelloWorld.htm).

It consists of the text to be presented interspersed with HTML markup tags that specify how that text should be displayed.   The filename usually ends in either .htm or .html to indicated that it can be displayed in a web browser.  The HTML markup standards have been around since the beginning of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web\">World Wide Web.</a>  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTML5</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5\">HTML5</a> is simply the 5th major revision of the HTML standards that added significant modern features that make some web pages very dynamic. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS\">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics.   While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale.   If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent.  Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish.   The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only.   A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives.   If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one.    A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database.  But, that is another subject for another day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript - A procedural programming language for web pages.</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript\">JavaScript</a> is a programming language inspired by Java that is meant to run inside a web page.   All of the actual work is performed by the web browser itself. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As discussed above, all of the above technologies can run on any computer with a web browser.  The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer.   You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive.  Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then using your file browser (Windows explorer or Mac Finder) to locate that file and open it as you would any other document. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, that is all that is needed.  However, that does not make any use of the internet or the World Wide Web.   The \"World Wide\" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=\"http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm\">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.   The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol.  After that the \':\' indicates the beginning of the location of the resource which usually starts with \'//\' followed by the name of the resource.   Try it yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific page (HelloWorld.htm).  A web server program running on that computer located the file for that page and other associated information and sent it back to your browser running on your computer.

Each account can contain a number of repositories, which can be made public or private access.   A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer\'s personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.   As work progresses on the local machine and certain testable milestones are reached, the local changes can be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To get an idea of how this looks visit <a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns\">my GitHub account.</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.

This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, update your resum√©, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.

Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.

You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resum√© or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Work globally','','inherit','closed','closed','','59-revision-v1','','','2024-02-16 17:10:47','2024-02-16 17:10:47','',59,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=225',0,'revision','',0),

A WordPress site is no exception. However, a WordPress site is significantly different than normal software projects in several regards:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>There is a lot of WordPress itself, as well as its Themes and Plugins that are contained in the public_html directory. That is OK, and it\'s worthwhile tracking changes to those files. For one, it is a good way to detect corruption in a site.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>The vast majority of the content of a WP site is in posts and pages. When an author writes a blog post or a page of any sort, it does not create any new web pages in public_html. This is a result of the fact that WP contains a powerful CMS (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\">ContentManagementSystem</a>). A CMS manages the content in a database not a directory full of fully rendered HTML pages. This is discussed more in the <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/full-stack/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"55\">Full stack</a> page. The actual content of a blog post or a page is stored as a separate record in the wp_posts table. Blog posts have a post_type of \'post\' and pages (like this one) have a post_type of \'page\'. There are in fact a number of other things that get stored in the wp_posts table. As a result of these items stored as records in a table, doing the GitHub tracking of the text of a file will not show changes in individual posts or pages.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dumping the SQL data for source control</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><p>Because the main visible content is stored in a database table it is necessary to extract the individual records of the wp_posts (and other tables) to textual form so the normal GitHub mechanisms can show it in a readable form. As a first step to doing that, I have written a shells script called \'<strong>dumpall</strong>\' that is kept in the public_html directory (for now). That script is run in a shell process on the WP host site before a Git commit and push commands are run to update the GitHub repository. This is step 1 in the GitHub issue #10 of the GitHub repository\'. Later, I will write a program to extract each record of the wp_posts table into a separate text file in a .data/posts directory. It will require some nicer format than a simple SQL dump.</p><br><p>One issue with the <strong>dumpall¬†</strong>script is that the SQL dump for a specific table creates an INSERT statement to create all records into the table, but all of those records are written to a single line. ¬†Thus when GitHub tries to show the differences between subsequent revisions of a file, it looks like one VERY long line with lots of differences. ¬† What I would rather have is an INSERT statement that puts each record on a separate line. ¬† I have written a shell alias that uses the sed command to split that INSERT line into many lines. ¬† Thus, in the .data directory of my GitHub repository you will see the original SQL dump in a file named <strong>wp_posts.sql</strong> and a version with the lines split named <strong>wp_posts.split.sql</strong>. ¬†I am pushing this change on Wednesday April 17th, 2024 so you should see the text of this post will be changed in the <strong>wp_posts.split.sql</strong> file.</p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dumping the markup for all pages and posts </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition to saving the SQL tables generally, I want to export the text of all the Pages and Posts as separate files.   This allows GitHub change tracking to present the textual changes to the posts and pages individually.    To do this I wrote two shell scripts named <strong>dumpPages</strong> and <strong>dumpPosts</strong>.   dumpPages uses the wp command line utility to get each page markup text into a file in the .pages directory.  The file is named <strong>page-&lt;name-of-page&gt;.wpmu</strong> . The .wpmu extension is my extension name for \"Word Press mark up\".    For example <strong>.pages/how-to-use-github-to-source-control-a-wordpress-site.wpmu</strong> contains the markup text of this page.   The dumpPosts command does the same for posts and stores them in the .posts directory. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When these commands are executed in a secure terminal connected to the server running this WordPress site,  then the markup is exposed as text files to the git program.

Yes, I keep an entire WordPress site captured in a repository.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Also checkout the repository in which I captured the process I went through in developing my next challenge:  <a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/Challenge-Interactive-rating-component\">Challenge-Interactive-rating-component</a>, look at the text of the file Notes.md to see how I did it. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Note that the GitHub site is where the public facing copy of your repository is stored.  But, you don\'t want to do your work there, in fact you can\'t.  Instead the idea is that you create a copy of that repository locally on your own machine and develop in that copy.     There are two ways to upload your progress at each step on the way.  One is the original \'git\' cli command.   That requires a little learning which is not a bad idea.  But there is a companion Desktop app that looks a lot like the GitHub.com site.  It is called <a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\">GitHub Desktop</a>.  You can download that from this link now and install it.  Alternatively, once you have created your first repository and want to \'clone\' it to your desktop machine, the cloning process will offer to install the desktop app for you and feed it the command to do the copy of your new repository.   </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>To get a feel for how this works, take the time to create a \'my first repo\' repository and clone it to your desktop machine.   Then code a simple \'HelloWorld.html\' page.  If you are not familiar with \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program\">Hello, World!</a>\" checkout the wikipedia page.  There you will find source for this simple starter app in almost any language known, including HTML.   When you have coded it, then use the desktop app to commit that and push it to your public repository.   </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Once you have it working locally and have pushed it to the GitHub site you can actually create a \'GitHub Page\' to publish the working page for the whole world to see.   To do that when looking at the repository in GitHub.com, you will see a number of tabs along the top:  \'&lt;&gt; Code\', \'Issues\', ... \'Settings\'.   Pick the Settings.   It will automatically fill in the repository name, and the Default branch will probably be set to \'main\'.    On the left side of the screen in the sidebar, under \'Code and automation\' there is an item named \'Pages\'.  Pick that.   Once there it\'s pretty easy.  Under \'Source\' there is a selector to pick the branch.   That should already say \'Deploy from a branch\'.   Leave that as it is.  Below that is a section labeled \'Branch\'.  In there are two buttons that should say \'None\' and \'Save\'.  It is not real obvious but click the \'None\' button and select the \'main\' branch\'.  Finally press the \'Save\' button.   It should then tell you \'Your GitHub Pages site is currently being built from the&nbsp;<code>main</code>&nbsp;branch.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/\">Learn more about configuring the publishing source for your site</a>.\'  In a few moments you can refresh that page and see a note near the top that says something like \'Your site is live at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.github.io/Hello-World/\">https://michaelkentburns.github.io/Hello-World/</a>Last&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/Hello-World/actions/runs/7922504847\">deployed</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<img width=\"14\" height=\"14\" src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5041124?s=28&amp;v=4\" alt=\"@MichaelKentBurns\"><a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns\">MichaelKentBurns</a>&nbsp;1 minute ago\'.   Just click that link or the \'Visit site\' button. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Now that it is published live, you can make a small change to your local copy of the program and commit and push that to GitHub and within a short time your change will be live.

That also eases the Linux learning curve.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>MacOS is based on Unix and the Mac Terminal app depends on Unix (Linux) shells for line mode interactive commands.

It consists of the text to be presented interspersed with HTML markup tags that specify how that text should be displayed.   The filename usually ends in either .htm or .html to indicated that it can be displayed in a web browser.  The HTML markup standards have been around since the beginning of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web\">World Wide Web.</a>  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTML5</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5\">HTML5</a> is simply the 5th major revision of the HTML standards that added significant modern features that make some web pages very dynamic. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS\">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics.   While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale.   If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent.  Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish.   The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only.   A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives.   If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one.    A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database.  But, that is another subject for another day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript - A procedural programming language for web pages.</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript\">JavaScript</a> is a programming language inspired by Java that is meant to run inside a web page.   All of the actual work is performed by the web browser itself. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As discussed above, all of the above technologies can run on any computer with a web browser.  The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer.   You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive.  Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then using your file browser (Windows explorer or Mac Finder) to locate that file and open it as you would any other document. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, that is all that is needed.  However, that does not make any use of the internet or the World Wide Web.   The \"World Wide\" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=\"http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm\">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.  The formal name for this address is a URL.  See the wikipedia page <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL\">A&nbsp;<strong>uniform resource locator</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>URL</strong>)</a> for details.  The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol which is one of several protocols as explained in the URL page.  After that the \':\' indicates the beginning of the location of the resource which usually starts with \'//\' followed by the name of the resource.   Try it yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific page (HelloWorld.htm).  A web server program running on that computer located the file for that page and other associated information and sent it back to your browser running on your computer.  Your browser then formatted it according to the HTML rules and you then see the results.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If, however, you have saved a web page on your local hard drive you would access it using the \'file\' protocol with an address something like this: \"<a>file://C:/Michael/HelloWorld.htm</a>\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The details of that is for the next page (<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/back-end-web/\">Back end web</a>).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Before you move on, remember this roadmap to your career</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A friend of mine who is a reader of this site has contributed a <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/about-michael/contributors/philemons-contributions/your-front-end-development-journey-a-step-by-step-roadmap/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"299\">roadmap to a Front-End development journey</a>.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Front end web','','inherit','closed','closed','','49-revision-v1','','','2024-03-30 17:56:32','2024-03-30 17:56:32','',49,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=308',0,'revision','',0),

(322,1,'2024-04-17 22:44:02','2024-04-17 22:44:02','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>As mentioned in the <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/work-globally/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"59\">Work globally page</a>, GitHub is an excellent way to keep a repository of a software project. A WordPress site is no exception. However, a WordPress site is significantly different than normal software projects in several regards:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>There is a lot of WordPress itself, as well as its Themes and Plugins that are contained in the public_html directory. That is OK, and it\'s worthwhile tracking changes to those files. For one, it is a good way to detect corruption in a site.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>The vast majority of the content of a WP site is in posts and pages. When an author writes a blog post or a page of any sort, it does not create any new web pages in public_html. This is a result of the fact that WP contains a powerful CMS (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\">ContentManagementSystem</a>). A CMS manages the content in a database not a directory full of fully rendered HTML pages. This is discussed more in the <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/full-stack/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"55\">Full stack</a> page. The actual content of a blog post or a page is stored as a separate record in the wp_posts table. Blog posts have a post_type of \'post\' and pages (like this one) have a post_type of \'page\'. There are in fact a number of other things that get stored in the wp_posts table. As a result of these items stored as records in a table, doing the GitHub tracking of the text of a file will not show changes in individual posts or pages.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Because the main visible content is stored in a database table it is necessary to extract the individual records of the wp_posts (and other tables) to textual form so the normal GitHub mechanisms can show it in a readable form. As a first step to doing that, I have written a shells script called \'<strong>dumpall</strong>\' that is kept in the public_html directory (for now). That script is run in a shell process on the WP host site before a Git commit and push commands are run to update the GitHub repository. This is step 1 in the GitHub issue #10 of the GitHub repository\'. Later, I will write a program to extract each record of the wp_posts table into a separate text file in a .data/posts directory. It will require some nicer format than a simple SQL dump.</p>\r\n<p>One issue with the <strong>dumpall¬†</strong>script is that the SQL dump for a specific table creates an INSERT statement to create all records into the table, but all of those records are written to a single line. ¬†Thus when GitHub tries to show the differences between subsequent revisions of a file, it looks like one VERY long line with lots of differences. ¬† What I would rather have is an INSERT statement that puts each record on a separate line. ¬† I have written a shell alias that uses the sed command to split that INSERT line into many lines. ¬† Thus, in the .data directory of my GitHub repository you will see the original SQL dump in a file named <strong>wp_posts.sql</strong> and a version with the lines split named <strong>wp_posts.split.sql</strong>. ¬†I am pushing this change on Wednesday April 17th, 2024 so you should see the text of this post will be changed in the <strong>wp_posts.split.sql</strong> file.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','How to use GitHub to source control a WordPress site','','inherit','closed','closed','','266-revision-v1','','','2024-04-17 22:44:02','2024-04-17 22:44:02','',266,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=322',0,'revision','',0),

Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then using your file browser (Windows explorer or Mac Finder) to locate that file and open it as you would any other document.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTML5</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5\">HTML5</a> is simply the 5th major revision of the HTML standards that added significant modern features that make some web pages very dynamic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>HTML5 is a significant evolution of HTML, introducing new features that enhance web development capabilities. Here are some key aspects:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Semantic Elements:</strong>&nbsp;HTML5 introduces semantic elements like&nbsp;<code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,&nbsp;<code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,&nbsp;<code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, etc., which provide more meaning to the content beyond just visual presentation. Search engines can better understand the structure of your webpage, aiding in searchability.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Multimedia Support:</strong>&nbsp;Gone are the days of relying solely on plugins like Flash. HTML5 offers built-in support for audio and video elements, allowing direct embedding of multimedia content within web pages.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Offline Capabilities:</strong>&nbsp;Web applications can leverage features like local storage and application cache to store data locally. This enables functionality even when the user is offline, improving user experience.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Improved Forms:</strong>&nbsp;HTML5 provides new input types like&nbsp;<code>email</code>,&nbsp;<code>url</code>,&nbsp;<code>date</code>, etc., simplifying user input validation and enhancing form functionality.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Canvas and SVG:</strong>&nbsp;Developers can create dynamic graphics, animations, and illustrations directly within web pages using the&nbsp;<code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>&nbsp;elements.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS\">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics. While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale. If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent. Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish. The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only. A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives. If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one. A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database. But, that is another subject for another day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Here is an example of a CSS docume</strong>nt</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":351,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/css-1-1024x444.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-351\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Advanced CSS Techniques:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While basic CSS covers fundamental styling, advanced techniques unlock more intricate visual effects and control:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>CSS Preprocessors (Sass, LESS):</strong>&nbsp;These add another layer of abstraction to CSS, allowing you to use variables, mixins, and functions for more maintainable and reusable code.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>CSS Frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS):</strong>&nbsp;These pre-built libraries provide pre-defined styles and components, accelerating the development process and ensuring consistency across your web project.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>CSS Grid and Flexbox:</strong>&nbsp;Techniques like CSS Grid and Flexbox offer enhanced flexibility in web page layout.

The \"World Wide\" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=\"http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm\">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.  The formal name for this address is a URL.  See the wikipedia page <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL\">A&nbsp;<strong>uniform resource locator</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>URL</strong>)</a> for details.  The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol which is one of several protocols as explained in the URL page.  After that the \':\' indicates the beginning of the location of the resource which usually starts with \'//\' followed by the name of the resource.   Try it yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific page (HelloWorld.htm).  A web server program running on that computer located the file for that page and other associated information and sent it back to your browser running on your computer.  Your browser then formatted it according to the HTML rules and you then see the results.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If, however, you have saved a web page on your local hard drive you would access it using the \'file\' protocol with an address something like this: \"<a>file://C:/Michael/HelloWorld.htm</a>\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The details of that is for the next page (<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/back-end-web/\">Back end web</a>).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Want to see web development concepts come to life?

Here are some key aspects:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Semantic Elements:</strong>&nbsp;HTML5 introduces semantic elements like&nbsp;<code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,&nbsp;<code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,&nbsp;<code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, etc., which provide more meaning to the content beyond just visual presentation. Search engines can better understand the structure of your webpage, aiding in searchability.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Multimedia Support:</strong>&nbsp;Gone are the days of relying solely on plugins like Flash. HTML5 offers built-in support for audio and video elements, allowing direct embedding of multimedia content within web pages.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Offline Capabilities:</strong>&nbsp;Web applications can leverage features like local storage and application cache to store data locally. This enables functionality even when the user is offline, improving user experience.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Improved Forms:</strong>&nbsp;HTML5 provides new input types like&nbsp;<code>email</code>,&nbsp;<code>url</code>,&nbsp;<code>date</code>, etc., simplifying user input validation and enhancing form functionality.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Canvas and SVG:</strong>&nbsp;Developers can create dynamic graphics, animations, and illustrations directly within web pages using the&nbsp;<code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>&nbsp;elements.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS\">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics. While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale. If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent. Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish. The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only. A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives. If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one. A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database. But, that is another subject for another day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Here is an example of a CSS docume</strong>nt</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":351,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/css-1-1024x444.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-351\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Advanced CSS Techniques:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While basic CSS covers fundamental styling, advanced techniques unlock more intricate visual effects and control:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>CSS Preprocessors (Sass, LESS):</strong>&nbsp;These add another layer of abstraction to CSS, allowing you to use variables, mixins, and functions for more maintainable and reusable code.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>CSS Frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS):</strong>&nbsp;These pre-built libraries provide pre-defined styles and components, accelerating the development process and ensuring consistency across your web project.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>CSS Grid and Flexbox:</strong>&nbsp;Techniques like CSS Grid and Flexbox offer enhanced flexibility in web page layout.

In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=\"http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm\">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.  The formal name for this address is a URL.  See the wikipedia page <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL\">A&nbsp;<strong>uniform resource locator</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>URL</strong>)</a> for details.  The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol which is one of several protocols as explained in the URL page.

Try it yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific page (HelloWorld.htm).  A web server program running on that computer located the file for that page and other associated information and sent it back to your browser running on your computer.

They had an idea of something good to build and they just dove in and started writing code. These were the pioneering days and most of these projects are called <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project\">skunk-works projects</a>.</strong> They often worked long hours and did not tell anyone what they built until it worked. Some famous projects were <strong>UNIX</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, the <strong>Macintosh Personal Computer</strong>, and other little things.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, as time went on and people started paying big money for big computers and needed big complex software, the whole process got big and complicated. Lots of money was raised, lots of people were hired, and customers were anxious to get the final product. This meant that you had to make promises of functionality and set dates for delivery. This meant that a lot of success was riding on getting it right. This was the era of the <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">waterfall method</a> </strong>of project planning. These projects costs many millions of dollars and often took many years to build. IBM was THE BIG player in such projects. They would often start several teams in different places of the world and give them all the same project. That caused a lot of competition between the teams. This is because as some teams fell behind their project was cancelled and the people often fired. In the end one team was selected as the victor. Many of these large projects involved multiple companies collaborating, and the end result was often gigantic failures.  Some examples are the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics\">Multics</a> operating system, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taligent\">Taligent</a>.  I\'ll bet you have never heard of either of them. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There were a handful of pioneers that decided there had to be a better way of project planning. One of the results of those efforts became a group of methods under the umbrella term<strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development\">Agile Software Development</a>.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are two stories I wish to share that are a quick introduction to Agile techniques.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Chicken and the Pig</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.michaelvizdos.com/resources/scrum-chicken-pig-cartoon-origin\">The cartoon: </a> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One day <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig\"><strong>a Chicken and a Pig</strong></a> decided they would open a restaurant together. As they each decided what they could contribute to the effort it became clear that they were very different from each other in their investment. The chicken pointed out that she could lay eggs almost every day, and with her fellow chickens they could bring fresh eggs to cook every day. However, when the pig volunteered its ham, he realized that his and his friends investment was a one time all in investment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What this funny story shows is that the \"boss\" or project sponsor has a small investment and he can have many projects some of which might succeed and some might fail.   However, the workers that worked full time on the project were investing their very livelihoods and all of their time.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agile moral of this story is that the boss gets to decide what the project should build and how it needs to function for the customer, but his interest stops there.  His job is to hire a team that are qualified to do the job, guide them along the way, and get them the resources they need to do the job.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The team however, gets to determine how they will organize the work, plan the schedule, and get the job done.  They are day to day, week by week, coordinating and working together as best they can to get it done on time and to requirements.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gummy Bears</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gummy_bear\">Gummy Bears are a favorite snack of children and software engineers. </a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many of the early agile teams wanted a quick and easy way to make rough estimates of the work required and how best to organize the effort.  They wanted to spend only a little time on the estimate and then simply get to work.   As they worked they kept rough track of the time spent on each task they had estimated and after every week or two (called a sprint like in Rugby) they took a few minutes to reflect on the sprint and their estimates versus actuals.   The idea is to slowly get better and better at estimating the effort for small pieces of the work so they could more accurately plan and finish small to large parts of the overall project.   Each sprint they get better and learn more.  That makes the next sprint planning meeting much quicker and more accurate.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One particular team always had a bowl of gummy bears on the table when they had their planning meetings.  So everybody grabbed a handful and put them on the table in front of themselves.    As they considered each task they would each put a certain number of bears out in front (like poker) and then explained why they thought that task was easy or hard to do.   After everybody made their bid, the team came to a quick agreement and assigned a number (usually between 1 and 7 bears) to a task.  Then they moved on.  The whole meeting goes pretty quick and soon they have a set of tasks to do in the sprint and assign those to capable engineers.    Done. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why something silly? Well many teams got a little more formal and ended up calling them \"<a href=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/points-estimates-in/\"><strong>Story Points</strong></a>\". The main idea is that it is a concept that each team uses to judge relative difficulty based on what they are capable of . You DON\'T want to use some real unit of time (like hours or days or weeks). Because once you do that, you have driven a stake in the ground and committed yourself to actually getting it done on that schedule. This leads to short cuts, burn out, and slipped schedules.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, what does it really mean to the team?  That is up to the team.  They have their own way of relating the effort for a specific task based on what similar tasks have been in their past.   Also, what ends up happening is that since their knowledge of the tasks grows and they get quicker at understanding and finishing tasks, they find out that they are getting faster at getting the tasks done.  We call this \"team velocity\".   As they get better they can get more gummy bears or story points done in a single sprint.    This is a very rewarding and motivating way of planning.  It is empowering.   The alternative of setting hard deadlines and then missing them or getting done too early is very de-motivating.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Much more to come...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->','How To Do Easy Time Estimates','','inherit','closed','closed','','404-revision-v1','','','2024-05-07 20:38:42','2024-05-07 20:38:42','',404,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=429',0,'revision','',0),

He is wearing several hats and juggling those hats effectively. He is scheduling weekly team meetings where they review the work done in the previous week and planning and initiating the new work to be done. Meanwhile, he monitors the work of Efatha as together they are working on the primary web page for the new site. Efatha is doing the HTML and CSS work to build the look and feel of the <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/front-end-web/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"49\"><strong>front end</strong></a> of the survey application. At the same time, Philemon is coding the JavaScript code to read in the actual survey questions and to write the survey answers to data storage. They are collaborating on the same program day by day using their own unique skills. As they do so, they are doing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review\"><strong>code reviews</strong></a> of each other\'s new code so that they understand how the pieces fit together and to make sure that the result meets the requirements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meanwhile, I (Michael) am monitoring their code commits and reviewing their code.  I also have a cloned copy of the project repository on my development machine here in Texas.   My contribution to the project is to manually test the working program as the end user (whose name is Fred) would.   Not only do I use it in my browser, but I also have my clone of the repository inside a working full stack server.   So, I am testing it as it will be fully deployed for the world to see and use.    I am also using a testing framework called <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software)\">Selenium</a> </strong>to automate the manual tests that I do.  As I manually do the testing,  Selenium captures all of my actions (click here, type there, scroll to somewhere else, ...) and the results of my actions.   After my test run, the captured actions are stored in a \"test case\" in the team\'s testing library.   Those test cases (and results) become part of the project repository that we all share.   When Efatha and Philemon are working on a new feature or fixing a bug, they will be able to push a button and watch all of my testing get replayed against their new code.  This way, they can quickly re-run all of my testing to make sure they have not broken anything.   This shows the two processes of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing\"><strong>Integration Testing</strong></a>, and <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation\">Test Automation</a>.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, Ash is busy on the deployment (<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/full-stack/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"55\"><strong>full stack)</strong></a> work that will become the live demonstration of this whole project.

There is certainly no surprise there.  The work is complicated and with everybody busy working on their assigned issues in the same project repository it is inevitable that we would discover issues that we did not anticipate.   We can choose to view these as setbacks, but they really are a reality and more importantly an opportunity for learning and process improvements. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take for instance the fact that both Efatha and Philemon were creating different versions of basically the same application.   It is not unusual for a web page to be called <strong>index.html</strong>.   The other complicating factor is that they both decided that since their pages were just test versions of what we hope to be the real application for this project, they would put their files in the /test directory.  Efatha pushed his first and when Philemon got around to pushing his copy from his repository there were now two \'test/index.html\' files that pushed.   When Philemon merged his into the shared GitHub repository there was a conflict.   The end result is that his code overwrote Efatha\'s.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Efatha was a bit surprised by this and he was confused as to how he should proceed.  He set about trying to figure out what to do about it.   He commented to me in a message in the Upwork discussion, and I said I would look into it.   However, the Upwork discussions are unique to each developer and myself.  When he asked me what to do, Philemon was not notified of the issue.   Until I figured it out, I was having two private conversations and I became the middle man.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the important principles of team dynamics is that at some level each team member should have a high level view of what the other team members are doing and any problems they might encounter.   Since we were communicating these issues through private Upwork messages there was not a common view of the situation.    The first lesson is that <strong>these kinds of issues that block progress must be communicated in the Issues list of the project repository.</strong>   Each of them were working on their own top level story.   Efatha\'s story was Issue #5, and Philemon\'s was Issue #6.   They were each focused on their issue and not seeing what was happening to the other.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The proper way to communicate these kinds of issues is for everybody to have a common view of the project, the issues each person is working on, and most important any high priority issues.   The solution is a proper set of Issue labels.  I added new labels to the issues list:   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>A bright purple label named <strong>\"Stuck !!\"</strong> is to be applied to an active issue that gets stuck.  In Efatha\'s case the \"Issue #5 creating the form with html and css\" now needs a \"Stuck!\" label.   That way when each team member reviews the Issues list they see that Efatha is stuck in his primary issue.   In addition to applying the label, Efatha should have simply added a comment to the issue explaining his problem.   That way when I and/or Philemon reviews the issues list (which should be done daily) we would quickly see that Efatha\'s primary task was \"Stuck!\".   Then we would simply open that discussion and see the problem.    So, early this morning I did what Efatha did not yet know he could have done.   In our meeting we discussed it and figured out the solution.   Part of the solution is that we now need a new issue.   </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>That new issue is \"<strong>#10 We need to decide the top level structure of our demo project.</strong>\"  I entered that and explained the problem and my proposal for how to setup the directory structure and how to name files.   I also created a new label colored red: <strong>\"High Priority!!\"</strong>.   If you hover over that label it explains: <strong>\"Drop what you are doing and pay attention!\"</strong>. The purpose of this label is a visual cue that each team member when daily reviewing the Issue board would see this and do as suggested.  They should suspend their normal work, open the new issue and read about the situation.   They would then read my suggestion and enter a comment that would either agree with my proposal or propose an alternative solution.   Sometimes they may decide it\'s not up to them, and they should enter a comment to that effect and then move on with their normal work.  This issue was not really new because Ash had commented that when reviewing Efatha\'s push for his issue #5.   But, since it was just a comment in a list of comments nobody paid close enough attention to realize the importance.   When I took Ash\'s comment and made a new issue of it, I also added <strong>\"High Priority!!\"</strong>.   Now, each team member should notice that, read the conversation, and add their comment.   Quickly we should arrive at a consensus opinion that someone should take responsibility to implement a solution.  When that solution is in place and pushed, they will update it with a comment that should cause the rest of the team to review their fix and comment that they agree that the solution fixes the problem.  At that point someone will remove the <strong>\"High Priority!!\"</strong> label. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One more example of these labels is in Philemon\'s <strong>Issue #6: \"creation of the json file structure and javascript code\" </strong>which is his \"Active\" \"Main story\".   During his demo of the current state of that,  he mentioned the problem that browsers don\'t allow Javascript code to write files to the user\'s local filesystem.    This is an important security mandate and rightly so.    However, our desire to write to the /responses folder is only a temporary solution which will go away when Ash gets a backend server running that allows our code to send the Json data directly to the backend for permanent storage.     So, I proposed a temporary workaround that allows us to demo his code, see the submitted json file, and get it stored.  As a result, I added the <strong>\"Stuck!\"</strong> label and explained the problem and my proposed solution.  I finished my comment with this: \"<strong>Give it a try. If that works for you, add a comment here and then remove the Stuck!! label and move on .</strong>\"   When Philemon sees my suggestion and tries it, and agrees that it works, he will comment to that effect, remove the \"Stuck!!\" label and then move on with his work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The bottom line on this post is:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>We have new labels that get attention and cause the team to act.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Each team member should daily take a look at the issues list and look for the labels \"bug\", \"Stuck!\", and \"High Priority!!\" and then stop and consider their role in the solution. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Each team member is empowered, encouraged, an able to enter new issues and add or remove labels to them as appropriate.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, please digest this post, make an effort to add these tools to your toolbox, and then comment on this post so I know you have absorbed and commit to applying these tools.

Efatha is doing the HTML and CSS work to build the look and feel of the <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/front-end-web/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"49\"><strong>front end</strong></a> of the survey application. At the same time, Philemon is coding the JavaScript code to read in the actual survey questions and to write the survey answers to data storage. They are collaborating on the same program day by day using their own unique skills.

I also have a cloned copy of the project repository on my development machine here in Texas.   My contribution to the project is to manually test the working program as the end user (whose name is Fred) would.   Not only do I use it in my browser, but I also have my clone of the repository inside a working full stack server.   So, I am testing it as it will be fully deployed for the world to see and use.    I am also using a testing framework called <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software)\">Selenium</a> </strong>to automate the manual tests that I do.  As I manually do the testing,  Selenium captures all of my actions (click here, type there, scroll to somewhere else, ...) and the results of my actions.   After my test run, the captured actions are stored in a \"test case\" in the team\'s testing library.   Those test cases (and results) become part of the project repository that we all share.   When Efatha and Philemon are working on a new feature or fixing a bug, they will be able to push a button and watch all of my testing get replayed against their new code.  This way, they can quickly re-run all of my testing to make sure they have not broken anything.

(461,1,'2024-06-02 19:59:27','2024-06-02 19:59:27','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Last week as the cohort-1 team was busy working on their respective parts of the demo project they hit a few speed bumps.    There is certainly no surprise there.  The work is complicated and with everybody busy working on their assigned issues in the same project repository it is inevitable that we would discover issues that we did not anticipate.   We can choose to view these as setbacks, but they really are a reality and more importantly an opportunity for learning and process improvements. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take for instance the fact that both Efatha and Philemon were creating different versions of basically the same application.   It is not unusual for a web page to be called <strong>index.html</strong>.   The other complicating factor is that they both decided that since their pages were just test versions of what we hope to be the real application for this project, they would put their files in the /test directory.  Efatha pushed his first and when Philemon got around to pushing his copy from his repository there were now two \'test/index.html\' files that pushed.   When Philemon merged his into the shared GitHub repository there was a conflict.   The end result is that his code overwrote Efatha\'s.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Efatha was a bit surprised by this and he was confused as to how he should proceed.  He set about trying to figure out what to do about it.   He commented to me in a message in the Upwork discussion, and I said I would look into it.   However, the Upwork discussions are unique to each developer and myself.  When he asked me what to do, Philemon was not notified of the issue.   Until I figured it out, I was having two private conversations and I became the middle man.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the important principles of team dynamics is that at some level each team member should have a high level view of what the other team members are doing and any problems they might encounter.   Since we were communicating these issues through private Upwork messages there was not a common view of the situation.    The first lesson is that <strong>these kinds of issues that block progress must be communicated in the Issues list of the project repository.</strong>   Each of them were working on their own top level story.   Efatha\'s story was Issue #5, and Philemon\'s was Issue #6.   They were each focused on their issue and not seeing what was happening to the other.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The proper way to communicate these kinds of issues is for everybody to have a common view of the project, the issues each person is working on, and most important any high priority issues.   The solution is a proper set of Issue labels.  I added new labels to the issues list:   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>A bright purple label named <strong>\"Stuck !!\"</strong> is to be applied to an active issue that gets stuck.  In Efatha\'s case the \"Issue #5 creating the form with html and css\" now needs a \"Stuck!\" label.   That way when each team member reviews the Issues list they see that Efatha is stuck in his primary issue.   In addition to applying the label, Efatha should have simply added a comment to the issue explaining his problem.   That way when I and/or Philemon reviews the issues list (which should be done daily) we would quickly see that Efatha\'s primary task was \"Stuck!\".   Then we would simply open that discussion and see the problem.    So, early this morning I did what Efatha did not yet know he could have done.   In our meeting we discussed it and figured out the solution.   Part of the solution is that we now need a new issue.   </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>That new issue is \"<strong>#10 We need to decide the top level structure of our demo project.</strong>\"  I entered that and explained the problem and my proposal for how to setup the directory structure and how to name files.   I also created a new label colored red: <strong>\"High Priority!!\"</strong>.   If you hover over that label it explains: <strong>\"Drop what you are doing and pay attention!\"</strong>. The purpose of this label is a visual cue that each team member when daily reviewing the Issue board would see this and do as suggested.  They should suspend their normal work, open the new issue and read about the situation.   They would then read my suggestion and enter a comment that would either agree with my proposal or propose an alternative solution.   Sometimes they may decide it\'s not up to them, and they should enter a comment to that effect and then move on with their normal work.  This issue was not really new because Ash had commented that when reviewing Efatha\'s push for his issue #5.   But, since it was just a comment in a list of comments nobody paid close enough attention to realize the importance.   When I took Ash\'s comment and made a new issue of it, I also added <strong>\"High Priority!!\"</strong>.   Now, each team member should notice that, read the conversation, and add their comment.   Quickly we should arrive at a consensus opinion that someone should take responsibility to implement a solution.  When that solution is in place and pushed, they will update it with a comment that should cause the rest of the team to review their fix and comment that they agree that the solution fixes the problem.  At that point someone will remove the <strong>\"High Priority!!\"</strong> label. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One more example of these labels is in Philemon\'s <strong>Issue #6: \"creation of the json file structure and javascript code\" </strong>which is his \"Active\" \"Main story\".   During his demo of the current state of that,  he mentioned the problem that browsers don\'t allow Javascript code to write files to the user\'s local filesystem.    This is an important security mandate and rightly so.    However, our desire to write to the /responses folder is only a temporary solution which will go away when Ash gets a backend server running that allows our code to send the Json data directly to the backend for permanent storage.     So, I proposed a temporary workaround that allows us to demo his code, see the submitted json file, and get it stored.  As a result, I added the <strong>\"Stuck!\"</strong> label and explained the problem and my proposed solution.  I finished my comment with this: \"<strong>Give it a try. If that works for you, add a comment here and then remove the Stuck!! label and move on .</strong>\"   When Philemon sees my suggestion and tries it, and agrees that it works, he will comment to that effect, remove the \"Stuck!!\" label and then move on with his work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The bottom line on this post is:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>We have new labels that get attention and cause the team to act.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Each team member should daily take a look at the issues list and look for the labels \"bug\", \"Stuck!\", and \"High Priority!!\" and then stop and consider their role in the solution. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Each team member is empowered, encouraged, an able to enter new issues and add or remove labels to them as appropriate.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, please digest this post, make an effort to add these tools to your toolbox, and then comment on this post so I know you have absorbed and commit to applying these tools.

Many developers have chosen to also use Linux as their local work computer.  We will discuss hosting servers a little later on this page, but for now we will consider Linux as a local development computer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Linux of course can be installed on PC\'s and Macintoshes.   It can be installed in a virtual machine on either of those platforms.   It also can run native on Windows using <a href=\"https://cygwin.com\">Cygwin</a> which gives an existing Windows user the ability to use both Windows apps and Linux apps interchangeably.   That also eases the Linux learning curve.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>MacOS is based on Unix and the Mac Terminal app depends on Unix (Linux) shells for line mode interactive commands.   There are many different shells available to choose from, but the most commonly used one in my experience is BASH.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you choose to run Linux as your native OS then you will almost always use a graphical user interface.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Windows</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With Windows you naturally have a graphical interface including Windows Explorer,  a web browser like InternetExplorer or Edge, an interactive command line tool like PowerShell or cmd.exe.   Using your browser there are applications galore that you can download and install.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition as mentioned above you can also install <a href=\"https://cygwin.com\">Cygwin</a> and get lots of Linux goodies as well.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Macintosh</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As mentioned above MacOS is really UNIX under the covers.   The Terminal window runs many different UNIX shells.   Many common development tools are available for download and install and ready for use.     </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, since Terminal gets you into the core of UNIX there are many UNIX, and Linux package managers available that will let you install just like you are in Linux.

One, just mentioned is an <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\">SSH</a> client</strong> that allows interactive terminal access as though the developer was directly typing on a terminal attached to the server machine.    I have discovered an app called <strong><a href=\"https://termius.com\">Termius</a></strong> that does this very well.

It can be installed in a virtual machine on either of those platforms.   It also can run native on Windows using <a href=\"https://cygwin.com\">Cygwin</a> which gives an existing Windows user the ability to use both Windows apps and Linux apps interchangeably.   That also eases the Linux learning curve.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>MacOS is based on Unix and the Mac Terminal app depends on Unix (Linux) shells for line mode interactive commands.   There are many different shells available to choose from, but the most commonly used one in my experience is BASH.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you choose to run Linux as your native OS then you will almost always use a graphical user interface.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Windows</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With Windows you naturally have a graphical interface including Windows Explorer,  a web browser like InternetExplorer or Edge, an interactive command line tool like PowerShell or cmd.exe.   Using your browser there are applications galore that you can download and install.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition as mentioned above you can also install <a href=\"https://cygwin.com\">Cygwin</a> and get lots of Linux goodies as well.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Macintosh</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As mentioned above MacOS is really UNIX under the covers.

I have discovered an app called <strong><a href=\"https://termius.com\">Termius</a></strong> that does this very well.

(474,1,'2024-06-02 21:38:00','2024-06-02 21:38:00','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the most critical and least successful parts of software development is estimating how long a project is going to take and meeting those estimates.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Long ago projects were small and done by small teams of highly motivated engineers. They had an idea of something good to build and they just dove in and started writing code. These were the pioneering days and most of these projects are called <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project\">skunk-works projects</a>.</strong> They often worked long hours and did not tell anyone what they built until it worked. Some famous projects were <strong>UNIX</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, the <strong>Macintosh Personal Computer</strong>, and other little things.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, as time went on and people started paying big money for big computers and needed big complex software, the whole process got big and complicated. Lots of money was raised, lots of people were hired, and customers were anxious to get the final product. This meant that you had to make promises of functionality and set dates for delivery. This meant that a lot of success was riding on getting it right. This was the era of the <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">waterfall method</a> </strong>of project planning. These projects costs many millions of dollars and often took many years to build. IBM was THE BIG player in such projects. They would often start several teams in different places of the world and give them all the same project. That caused a lot of competition between the teams. This is because as some teams fell behind their project was cancelled and the people often fired. In the end one team was selected as the victor. Many of these large projects involved multiple companies collaborating, and the end result was often gigantic failures.  Some examples are the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics\">Multics</a> operating system, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taligent\">Taligent</a>.  I\'ll bet you have never heard of either of them. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There were a handful of pioneers that decided there had to be a better way of project planning. One of the results of those efforts became a group of methods under the umbrella term<strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development\">Agile Software Development</a>.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are two stories I wish to share that are a quick introduction to Agile techniques.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Chicken and the Pig</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.michaelvizdos.com/resources/scrum-chicken-pig-cartoon-origin\">The cartoon: </a> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One day <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig\"><strong>a Chicken and a Pig</strong></a> decided they would open a restaurant together. As they each decided what they could contribute to the effort it became clear that they were very different from each other in their investment. The chicken pointed out that she could lay eggs almost every day, and with her fellow chickens they could bring fresh eggs to cook every day. However, when the pig volunteered its ham, he realized that his and his friends investment was a one time all in investment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What this funny story shows is that the \"boss\" or project sponsor has a small investment and he can have many projects some of which might succeed and some might fail.   However, the workers that worked full time on the project were investing their very livelihoods and all of their time.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The agile moral of this story is that the boss gets to decide what the project should build and how it needs to function for the customer, but his interest stops there.  His job is to hire a team that are qualified to do the job, guide them along the way, and get them the resources they need to do the job.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The team however, gets to determine how they will organize the work, plan the schedule, and get the job done.  They are day to day, week by week, coordinating and working together as best they can to get it done on time and to requirements.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gummy Bears</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gummy_bear\">Gummy Bears are a favorite snack of children and software engineers. </a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many of the early agile teams wanted a quick and easy way to make rough estimates of the work required and how best to organize the effort.  They wanted to spend only a little time on the estimate and then simply get to work.   As they worked they kept rough track of the time spent on each task they had estimated and after every week or two (called a sprint like in Rugby) they took a few minutes to reflect on the sprint and their estimates versus actuals.   The idea is to slowly get better and better at estimating the effort for small pieces of the work so they could more accurately plan and finish small to large parts of the overall project.   Each sprint they get better and learn more.  That makes the next sprint planning meeting much quicker and more accurate.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One particular team always had a bowl of gummy bears on the table when they had their planning meetings.  So everybody grabbed a handful and put them on the table in front of themselves.    As they considered each task they would each put a certain number of bears out in front (like poker) and then explained why they thought that task was easy or hard to do.   After everybody made their bid, the team came to a quick agreement and assigned a number (usually between 1 and 7 bears) to a task.  Then they moved on.  The whole meeting goes pretty quick and soon they have a set of tasks to do in the sprint and assign those to capable engineers.    Done. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why something silly? Well many teams got a little more formal and ended up calling them \"<a href=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/points-estimates-in/\"><strong>Story Points</strong></a>\". The main idea is that it is a concept that each team uses to judge relative difficulty based on what they are capable of . You DON\'T want to use some real unit of time (like hours or days or weeks). Because once you do that, you have driven a stake in the ground and committed yourself to actually getting it done on that schedule. This leads to short cuts, burn out, and slipped schedules.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, what does it really mean to the team?  That is up to the team.  They have their own way of relating the effort for a specific task based on what similar tasks have been in their past.   Also, what ends up happening is that since their knowledge of the tasks grows and they get quicker at understanding and finishing tasks, they find out that they are getting faster at getting the tasks done.  We call this \"team velocity\".   As they get better they can get more gummy bears or story points done in a single sprint.    This is a very rewarding and motivating way of planning.  It is empowering.
