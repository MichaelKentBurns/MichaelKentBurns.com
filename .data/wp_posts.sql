It consists of the text to be presented interspersed with HTML markup tags that specify how that text should be displayed.   The filename usually ends in either .htm or .html to indicated that it can be displayed in a web browser.  The HTML markup standards have been around since the beginning of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web\">World Wide Web.</a>  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTML5</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5\">HTML5</a> is simply the 5th major revision of the HTML standards that added significant modern features that make some web pages very dynamic. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS\">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics.   While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale.   If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent.  Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish.   The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only.   A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives.   If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one.    A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database.  But, that is another subject for another day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript - A procedural programming language for web pages.</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript\">JavaScript</a> is a programming language inspired by Java that is meant to run inside a web page.   All of the actual work is performed by the web browser itself. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As discussed above, all of the above technologies can run on any computer with a web browser.  The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer.   You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive.  Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then using your file browser (Windows explorer or Mac Finder) to locate that file and open it as you would any other document. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, that is all that is needed.  However, that does not make any use of the internet or the World Wide Web.   The \"World Wide\" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=\"http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm\">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.   The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol.  After that the \':\' indicates the beginning of the location of the resource which usually starts with \'//\' followed by the name of the resource.   Try it yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific page (HelloWorld.htm).  A web server program running on that computer located the file for that page and other associated information and sent it back to your browser running on your computer.  Your browser then formatted it according to the HTML rules and you then see the results.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The details of that is for the next page (<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/back-end-web/\">Back end web</a>).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',	'Front end web',	'',	'publish',	'closed',	'closed',	'',	'front-end-web',	'',	'',	'2024-02-16 16:51:24',	'2024-02-16 16:51:24',	'',	0,	'https://michaelkentburns.com/?page_id=49',	0,	'page',	'',	0),

As an example look at <strong><a href=\"https://www.frontendmentor.io\">Frontend Mentor.</a></strong>  This site is helpfully setup to capture your work for each challenge in a GitHub repository.  While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional in utilizing the features of Git.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you begin a challenge, you should </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Create a new repository to house it.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Download the initial codebase provided, and push that to GitHub as your starting point.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Take the first step in the challenge, then test it, and finally push that work.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Test all the features you have done so far during the challenge.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>If you find a bug or perhaps a new feature or enhancement, stop and create an issue in the repository.   You don\'t have to fix it immediately, but it is very important to record the issue and steps to reproduce it.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Continue your work stepwise capturing each step by pushing it with a descriptive comment.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Finally, or during the course of your work, look at the outstanding issues and pick one or two to address.  As each is fixed push the fix and close the issue. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to create a ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, update your resumé, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create a project with other developers.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you learn with your friends take the opportunity to propose an original project that you all can work on together.   Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.   This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about. </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resumé or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',	'Work globally...',	'',	'inherit',	'closed',	'closed',	'',	'59-revision-v1',	'',	'',	'2023-04-03 21:31:38',	'2023-04-03 21:31:38',	'',	59,	'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=75',	0,	'revision',	'',	0),

This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, update your resumé, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.

This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about it. </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resumé or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',	'Work globally...',	'',	'inherit',	'closed',	'closed',	'',	'59-revision-v1',	'',	'',	'2024-02-09 23:07:35',	'2024-02-09 23:07:35',	'',	59,	'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=148',	0,	'revision',	'',	0),

With a little effort you will be able to learn more about the other team members and their roles as well as learn more about the larger project.   As you develop your skills you can build a reputation of trust.   Open source software projects are a great opportunity because they depend on volunteer contributions.  But, it should be noted that all work done for open software projects is not done for free.  The companies or organizations that rely on open source software often have specific needs that are not necessarily shared by the community at large.   These organizations will often pay their employees, or outside developers, to work on their special needs.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many open source projects are dependent on other open source projects.

One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.

This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about it. </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resumé or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',	'Work globally',	'',	'inherit',	'closed',	'closed',	'',	'59-revision-v1',	'',	'',	'2024-02-10 23:38:34',	'2024-02-10 23:38:34',	'',	59,	'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=164',	0,	'revision',	'',	0),

It can be installed in a virtual machine on either of those platforms.   It also can run native on Windows using <a href=\"https://cygwin.com\">Cygwin</a> which gives an existing Windows user the ability to use both Windows apps and Linux apps interchangeably.   That also eases the Linux learning curve.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>MacOS is based on Unix and the Mac Terminal app depends on Unix (Linux) shells for line mode interactive commands.

Many developers have chosen to also use Linux as their local work computer.  We will discuss hosting servers a little later on this page, but for now we will consider Linux as a local development computer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Linux of course can be installed on PC\'s and Macintoshes.   It can be installed in a virtual machine on either of those platforms.   It also can run native on Windows using <a href=\"https://cygwin.com\">Cygwin</a> which gives an existing Windows user the ability to use both Windows apps and Linux apps interchangeably.   That also eases the Linux learning curve.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>MacOS is based on Unix and the Mac Terminal app depends on Unix (Linux) shells for line mode interactive commands.   There are many different shells available to choose from, but the most commonly used one in my experience is BASH.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you choose to run Linux as your native OS then you will almost always a graphical user interface.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Windows</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With Windows you naturally have a graphical interface include Windows Explorer,  a web browser like Edge, an interactive command line tool like PowerShell or cmd.exe.

The Terminal window runs many different UNIX shells.   Many common development tools are available for download and install and ready for use.     </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, since Terminal gets you into the core of UNIX there are many UNIX, and Linux package managers available that will let you install just like you are in Linux.  Homebrew is one option.   Just Google \'<a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?hps=1&amp;q=package+managers+for+mac&amp;ia=web\">package managers for mac</a>\'</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Web hosting servers</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most servers are virtual machines in a cloud server farms.

Yes, I keep an entire WordPress site captured in a repository.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Also checkout the repository in which I captured the process I went through in developing my next challenge:  <a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/Challenge-Interactive-rating-component\">Challenge-Interactive-rating-component</a>, look at the text of the file Notes.md to see how I did it. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Note that the GitHub site is where the public facing copy of your repository is stored.  But, you don\'t want to do your work there, in fact you can\'t.  Instead the idea is that you create a copy of that repository locally on your own machine and develop in that copy.     There are two ways to upload your progress at each step on the way.  One is the original \'git\' cli command.   That requires a little learning which is not a bad idea.  But there is a companion Desktop app that looks a lot like the GitHub.com site.  It is called <a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\">GitHub Desktop</a>.  You can download that from this link now and install it.  Alternatively, once you have created your first repository and want to \'clone\' it to your desktop machine, the cloning process will offer to install the desktop app for you and feed it the command to do the copy of your new repository.   </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>To get a feel for how this works, take the time to create a \'my first repo\' repository and clone it to your desktop machine.   Then code a simple \'HelloWorld.html\' page.  If you are not familiar with \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program\">Hello, World!</a>\" checkout the wikipedia page.  There you will find source for this simple starter app in almost any language known, including HTML.   When you have coded it, then use the desktop app to commit that and push it to your public repository.   </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Once you have it working locally and have pushed it to the GitHub site you can actually create a \'GitHub Page\' to publish the working page for the whole world to see.   To do that when looking at the repository in GitHub.com, you will see a number of tabs along the top:  \'&lt;> Code\', \'Issues\', ... \'Settings\'.   Pick the Settings.   It will automatically fill in the repository name, and the Default branch will probably be set to \'main\'.    On the left side of the screen in the sidebar, under \'Code and automation\' there is an item named \'Pages\'.  Pick that.   Once there it\'s pretty easy.

Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With all that in mind you should take action now by taking my <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/challenge-setup-your-own-github-account-and-install-desktop-github-app/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"187\">Challenge: Setup your own GitHub account and install Desktop GitHub app</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Capture your learning in a repository.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many tutorial sites to help you learn new skills.  As an example look at <strong><a href=\"https://www.frontendmentor.io\">Frontend Mentor.</a></strong>  This site is helpfully setup to capture your work for each challenge in a GitHub repository.  While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional in utilizing the features of Git.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you begin a challenge, you should create a GitHub repository and do all of your work step by step capturing your work as you go.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are ready to try that, go to the challenge page </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Create a new repository to house it.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Download the initial codebase provided, and push that to GitHub as your starting point.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Take the first step in the challenge, then test it, and finally push that work.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Test all the features you have done so far during the challenge.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>If you find a bug or perhaps a new feature or enhancement, stop and create an issue in the repository.   You don\'t have to fix it immediately, but it is very important to record the issue and steps to reproduce it.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Continue your work stepwise capturing each step by pushing it with a descriptive comment.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Finally, or during the course of your work, look at the outstanding issues and pick one or two to address.  As each is fixed push the fix and close the issue. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to create a ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, update your resumé, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create a project with other developers.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you learn with your friends take the opportunity to propose an original project that you all can work on together.   Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.   This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about it. </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resumé or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',	'Work globally',	'',	'inherit',	'closed',	'closed',	'',	'59-revision-v1',	'',	'',	'2024-02-15 22:07:48',	'2024-02-15 22:07:48',	'',	59,	'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=197',	0,	'revision',	'',	0),

As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resumé or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',	'Work globally',	'',	'inherit',	'closed',	'closed',	'',	'59-autosave-v1',	'',	'',	'2024-02-16 17:10:14',	'2024-02-16 17:10:14',	'',	59,	'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=221',	0,	'revision',	'',	0),

I also used GitHub Pages to publish the end result for the world to see.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here is my project repository:   <a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/Challenge-Interactive-rating-component/\">https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/Challenge-Interactive-rating-component/</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you have looked at mine, do your own.

I actually use Git to control the source of this entire WordPress site. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are command line versions of git for all major desktop systems.  One of the more popular graphical interfaces for git is <a href=\"https://desktop.github.com\"><strong>GitDesktop</strong></a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub\"><strong>GitHub</strong></a> is a web interface for software development which uses Git for the source control features, and describes itself as collaborative version control.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>GitHub</strong> supports the creation of personal accounts.  Each account can contain a number of repositories, which can be made public or private access.   A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer\'s personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.   As work progresses on the local machine and certain testable milestones are reached, the local changes can be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To get an idea of how this looks visit <a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns\">my GitHub account.</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.   Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With all that in mind you should take action now by taking my <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/challenge-setup-your-own-github-account-and-install-desktop-github-app/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"187\">Challenge: Setup your own GitHub account and install Desktop GitHub app</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Capture your learning in a repository.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many tutorial sites to help you learn new skills.  As an example look at <strong><a href=\"https://www.frontendmentor.io\">Frontend Mentor.</a></strong>  It is a good practice to capture your work for each challenge in a GitHub repository.  While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional about utilizing the features of Git.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you begin a challenge, you should create a GitHub repository and do all of your work step by step capturing your work as you go.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are ready to try that, go to<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/challenge-capture-a-tutorial-project-in-a-github-repository/\"> the challenge page</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to update the ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, update your resumé, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create a project with other developers.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you learn with your friends take the opportunity to propose an original project that you all can work on together.   Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.   This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about it. </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resumé or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',	'Work globally',	'',	'inherit',	'closed',	'closed',	'',	'59-revision-v1',	'',	'',	'2024-02-16 17:10:47',	'2024-02-16 17:10:47',	'',	59,	'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=225',	0,	'revision',	'',	0),

It can be installed in a virtual machine on either of those platforms.

That also eases the Linux learning curve.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>MacOS is based on Unix and the Mac Terminal app depends on Unix (Linux) shells for line mode interactive commands.

With a little effort you will be able to learn more about the other team members and their roles as well as learn more about the larger project.   As you develop your skills you can build a reputation of trust.   Open source software projects are a great opportunity because they depend on volunteer contributions.  But, it should be noted that all work done for open software projects is not done for free.  The companies or organizations that rely on open source software often have specific needs that are not necessarily shared by the community at large.   These organizations will often pay their employees, or outside developers, to work on their special needs.  A close friend of mine does exactly this at SAS where I retired from. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many open source projects are dependent on other open source projects.
