If you happen to live in one of those places, jobs can come looking for you.   But there are many places around the world that have little or no jobs in this field.  In those places you need some extra skills to get and keep work, but it can be done.  This site is a place to find help and to build community of fellow developers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Learn a little about me and why I am developing this site on my <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/about-michael/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"22\">About page...</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Welcome</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My intention with this main page is to tell a story of a journey that you might be on.

When you do, I invite you to contact me.  My intention is that I can help guide you along.   I hope that this will become a community of like minded people.  I invite you to help me understand your needs and together we will keep you moving.  No tricks or fees are involved.

The HTML markup standards have been around since the beginning of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web\">World Wide Web.</a>  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTML5</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5\">HTML5</a> is simply the 5th major revision of the HTML standards that added significant modern features that make some web pages very dynamic. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS\">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics.   While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale.   If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent.  Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish.   The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only.   A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives.   If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one.    A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database.  But, that is another subject for another day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript - A procedural programming language for web pages.</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript\">JavaScript</a> is a programming language inspired by Java that is meant to run inside a web page.   All of the actual work is performed by the web browser itself. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As discussed above, all of the above technologies can run on any computer with a web browser.  The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer.   You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive.  Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then using your file browser (Windows explorer or Mac Finder) to locate that file and open it as you would any other document. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, that is all that is needed.  However, that does not make any use of the internet or the World Wide Web.   The \"World Wide\" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=\"http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm\">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.  The formal name for this address is a URL.  See the wikipedia page <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL\">A&nbsp;<strong>uniform resource locator</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>URL</strong>)</a> for details.  The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol which is one of several protocols as explained in the URL page.  After that the \':\' indicates the beginning of the location of the resource which usually starts with \'//\' followed by the name of the resource.   Try it yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific page (HelloWorld.htm).  A web server program running on that computer located the file for that page and other associated information and sent it back to your browser running on your computer.  Your browser then formatted it according to the HTML rules and you then see the results.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If, however, you have saved a web page on your local hard drive you would access it using the \'file\' protocol with an address something like this: \"<a>file://C:/Michael/HelloWorld.htm</a>\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The details of that is for the next page (<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/back-end-web/\">Back end web</a>).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Before you move on, remember this roadmap to your career</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A friend of mine who is a reader of this site has contributed a <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/about-michael/contributors/philemons-contributions/your-front-end-development-journey-a-step-by-step-roadmap/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"299\">roadmap to a Front-End development journey</a>.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Front end web','','publish','closed','closed','','front-end-web','','','2024-03-30 17:56:32','2024-03-30 17:56:32','',0,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?page_id=49',0,'page','',0),(50,1,'2024-02-15 21:57:29','2023-04-03 18:34:12',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','50','','','2024-02-15 21:57:29','2024-02-15 21:57:29','',0,'https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/2023/04/03/50/',4,'nav_menu_item','',0),(51,1,'2023-04-03 18:34:12','2023-04-03 18:34:12','','Front end web','','inherit','closed','closed','','49-revision-v1','','','2023-04-03 18:34:12','2023-04-03 18:34:12','',49,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=51',0,'revision','',0),(52,1,'2023-04-03 18:36:03','2023-04-03 18:36:03','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While the front end is mostly concerned with the actual presentation of web information, there is much that the web browser cannot do.   One thing certainly is multitasking.  It is rare that a single person, using their browser to view a web page, is the only user at that specific site.  The back end is run on a more powerful machine that can server up web pages to many users around the world at the same time.

As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resumé or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Work globally...','','inherit','closed','closed','','59-revision-v1','','','2023-04-03 21:31:38','2023-04-03 21:31:38','',59,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=75',0,'revision','',0),(79,1,'2023-04-04 17:01:08','2023-04-04 17:01:08','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are a number of freelancing sites that allow both clients (customers) and talent (workers) to connect.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One very general international site is <a href=\"https://upwork.com\">Upwork</a>.

But be very careful because any failure can damage your reputation.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Finding work','','publish','closed','closed','','finding-work','','','2024-02-16 15:52:42','2024-02-16 15:52:42','',0,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?page_id=79',0,'page','',0),(80,1,'2024-02-16 16:02:49','2023-04-04 17:01:08',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','80','','','2024-02-16 16:02:49','2024-02-16 16:02:49','',0,'https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/2023/04/04/80/',8,'nav_menu_item','',0),(81,1,'2023-04-04 17:01:08','2023-04-04 17:01:08','','Finding work','','inherit','closed','closed','','79-revision-v1','','','2023-04-04 17:01:08','2023-04-04 17:01:08','',79,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=81',0,'revision','',0),(83,1,'2023-04-04 17:05:55','2023-04-04 17:05:55','<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":12,\"width\":410,\"height\":273,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mentor-mentee-1-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12\" width=\"410\" height=\"273\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Software development freelancing...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many locations around the globe that are hotspots for software development.

It consists of the text to be presented interspersed with HTML markup tags that specify how that text should be displayed.   The filename usually ends in either .htm or .html to indicated that it can be displayed in a web browser.  The HTML markup standards have been around since the beginning of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web\">World Wide Web.</a>  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTML5</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5\">HTML5</a> is simply the 5th major revision of the HTML standards that added significant modern features that make some web pages very dynamic. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS\">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript - A procedural programming language for web pages.</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript\">JavaScript</a> is a programming language inspired by Java that is meant to run inside a web page.   All of the actual work is performed by the web browser itself. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As discussed above, all of the above technologies can run on any computer with a web browser.  The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer.   You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive.  Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then using your file browser (Windows explorer or Mac Finder) to locate that file and open it as you would any other document. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, that is all that is needed.

The \"World Wide\" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=\"http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm\">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.   The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol.

Try it yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific page (HelloWorld.htm).  A program called a web server running on that computer located the file for that page and other associated information and sent it back to your browser running on your computer.  Your browser then formatted it according to the HTML rules and you then see the results.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The details of that is for the next page (<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/back-end-web/\">Back end web</a>).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Front end web','','inherit','closed','closed','','49-revision-v1','','','2024-01-23 17:49:02','2024-01-23 17:49:02','',49,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=141',0,'revision','',0),(143,1,'2024-01-23 20:30:20','2024-01-23 20:30:20','<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":86,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AdobeStock_142610858-1024x684.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-86\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Software development freelancing...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many locations around the globe that are hotspots for software development.

As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.

A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer\'s personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.

You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resumé or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Work globally','','inherit','closed','closed','','59-revision-v1','','','2024-02-10 23:38:34','2024-02-10 23:38:34','',59,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=164',0,'revision','',0),(167,1,'2024-02-10 23:44:05','2024-02-10 23:44:05','<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":86,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AdobeStock_142610858-1024x684.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-86\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Software development freelancing...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many locations around the globe that are hotspots for software development.

But, you don\'t want to do your work there, in fact you can\'t.  Instead the idea is that you create a copy of that repository locally on your own machine and develop in that copy.     There are two ways to upload your progress at each step on the way.  One is the original \'git\' cli command.   That requires a little learning which is not a bad idea.  But there is a companion Desktop app that looks a lot like the GitHub.com site.  It is called <a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\">GitHub Desktop</a>.  You can download that from this link now and install it.

It will automatically fill in the repository name, and the Default branch will probably be set to \'main\'.    On the left side of the screen in the sidebar, under \'Code and automation\' there is an item named \'Pages\'.  Pick that.   Once there it\'s pretty easy.  Under \'Source\' there is a selector to pick the branch.   That should already say \'Deploy from a branch\'.   Leave that as it is.  Below that is a section labeled \'Branch\'.

Each account can contain a number of repositories, which can be made public or private access.   A personal account allows a developer to create a repository for each project that is being worked on.   On the developer\'s personal machine, a matching copy of the GitHub repository can be made in a process called cloning.   As work progresses on the local machine and certain testable milestones are reached, the local changes can be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To get an idea of how this looks visit <a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns\">my GitHub account.</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using a GitHub account with repositories for each project that you have done allows others (if your repo is public) to see not only your code and documentation, but also the process you used to make the changes.   Each time you fix a bug or add a new feature, you should push that to GitHub with a comment that describes the fix or new feature.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With all that in mind you should take action now by taking my <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/challenge-setup-your-own-github-account-and-install-desktop-github-app/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"187\">Challenge: Setup your own GitHub account and install Desktop GitHub app</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Capture your learning in a repository.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many tutorial sites to help you learn new skills.  As an example look at <strong><a href=\"https://www.frontendmentor.io\">Frontend Mentor.</a></strong>  This site is helpfully setup to capture your work for each challenge in a GitHub repository.  While it seems natural to download the starting material and jump right into the work, resist this urge and be very intentional in utilizing the features of Git.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you begin a challenge, you should create a GitHub repository and do all of your work step by step capturing your work as you go.    </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are ready to try that, go to the challenge page </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Create a new repository to house it.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Download the initial codebase provided, and push that to GitHub as your starting point.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Take the first step in the challenge, then test it, and finally push that work.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Test all the features you have done so far during the challenge.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>If you find a bug or perhaps a new feature or enhancement, stop and create an issue in the repository.   You don\'t have to fix it immediately, but it is very important to record the issue and steps to reproduce it.  </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Continue your work stepwise capturing each step by pushing it with a descriptive comment.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Finally, or during the course of your work, look at the outstanding issues and pick one or two to address.  As each is fixed push the fix and close the issue. </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you are all finished with the challenge, take the time to create a ReadMe file in the repository.   In the first paragraph, and prominently marked, describe the specific skills demonstrated.  For instance if you are learning new HTML5 multimedia tags, list those.   This will be important when you start looking for work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, update your resumé, CV, or Upwork profile to have a link to that repository.  A prospect client reading your profile will be able to click on that and see a clear demonstration that you actually do know that specific skill.    One final note is that when you do a real project of your own design,  replace the link to the challenge repository with a link to your own original project repository.   Putting your skills to work on a project of your own design shows that you really know how and why to use that skill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create a project with other developers.</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you learn with your friends take the opportunity to propose an original project that you all can work on together.   Get a consensus of the scope and focus of the project, but feel free to include some features that require a skill that only a few collaborators know well.   This teaches the real world reality that open-source software is a collaboration of many people to build and enhance projects that no single person can achieve alone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search GitHub for a project that you are interested in learning more about it. </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take some time to browse the galaxy of open-source projects in GitHub and find ones that you know about, or are interested in learning about.   You can actively follow the work of others, and can review the code that has been pushed to see how it has been coded.    Clone the repository to your local machine so you have a working copy.  As you test it out and find bugs or desired features, consider creating an issue in the GitHub project.   Note that some repositories have restrictions about who can do what.   By following projects, you will learn.  As you submit features, and if you get a chance to fix an issue you will start building your public credentials.   When you do that, be sure to update your resumé or CV or profile to point the projects you have participated in.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Work globally','','inherit','closed','closed','','59-revision-v1','','','2024-02-15 22:07:48','2024-02-15 22:07:48','',59,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=197',0,'revision','',0),(199,1,'2024-02-15 22:31:09','2024-02-15 22:31:09','<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":169,\"width\":\"678px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized is-style-default\"><img src=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MichaelAtWork-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-169\" style=\"width:678px;height:auto\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Software development freelancing...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many locations around the globe that are hotspots for software development.

The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer.   You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive.  Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then using your file browser (Windows explorer or Mac Finder) to locate that file and open it as you would any other document. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, that is all that is needed.  However, that does not make any use of the internet or the World Wide Web.   The \"World Wide\" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=\"http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm\">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.   The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol.  After that the \':\' indicates the beginning of the location of the resource which usually starts with \'//\' followed by the name of the resource.   Try it yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific page (HelloWorld.htm).  A web server program running on that computer located the file for that page and other associated information and sent it back to your browser running on your computer.  Your browser then formatted it according to the HTML rules and you then see the results.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The details of that is for the next page (<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/back-end-web/\">Back end web</a>).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Front end web','','inherit','closed','closed','','49-revision-v1','','','2024-02-16 16:51:24','2024-02-16 16:51:24','',49,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=220',0,'revision','',0),(221,1,'2024-02-16 17:10:14','2024-02-16 17:10:14','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">GitHub</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With the advent of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software\"><strong>open-source software</strong></a> there arose the need to have world wide access to the source code for the many projects.   <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git\"><strong>Git</strong></a> is the source control tool invented for Linux development, but it is now widely used on all platforms, operating systems, and languages.

The companies or organizations that rely on open source software often have specific needs that are not necessarily shared by the community at large.

I use Cloudways, but there are others such as WPEngine.   In order to do development in those environments a developer needs to know Linux, shell, and remote headless environments including secure shell access.   The software that must be installed on a remote server is frequently referred to as LAMP, which stands for <strong>L</strong>inux Apache MySQL, PHP.    Typically, LAMP is installed as a series of servers which much be installed and configured on a Linux machine.  That is a fairly complex setup beyond the beginner Web developer. </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>There is also a Macintosh equivalent called <strong>M</strong>AMP where <strong>M</strong> stands for Macintosh rather than Linux.   MAMP is neatly packaged up as a single downloadable application.   When you run the MAMP application it presents a simple control panel that allows you to start, stop, and monitor all of the various servers that are built into the application.   </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>However, for developers without those skills there are also several open source solutions that allow you to run a full stack environment on a Mac, Linux, or Windows personal computer.   One that I choose is called XAMPP.   The \'<strong>X</strong>\'  means that it will run on Linux, Windows, or Macintosh.      The one great simplification is that it is all packaged up as a single application like MAMP is. </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:group {\"layout\":{\"type\":\"flex\",\"flexWrap\":\"nowrap\"}} -->\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html\">XAMPP</a> is available from an open source software group named <a href=\"https://www.apachefriends.org\">Apache Friends</a>.

It will require some nicer format than a simple SQL dump.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','How to use GitHub to source control a WordPress site','','inherit','closed','closed','','266-autosave-v1','','','2024-03-09 00:00:25','2024-03-09 00:00:25','',266,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=268',0,'revision','',0),(269,1,'2024-03-09 00:01:38','2024-03-09 00:01:38','<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Getting to the administrative control panel.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/how-to/how-to-administer-a-wordpress-site/how-to-use-github-to-source-control-a-wordpress-site/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"266\">How to use GitHub to source control a WordPress site</a>.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->','How to administer a WordPress site','','inherit','closed','closed','','111-revision-v1','','','2024-03-09 00:01:38','2024-03-09 00:01:38','',111,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=269',0,'revision','',0),(270,1,'2024-03-09 00:16:42','2024-03-09 00:16:42','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While the front end is mostly concerned with the actual presentation of web information, there is much that the web browser cannot do.

It will automatically fill in the repository name, and the Default branch will probably be set to \'main\'.    On the left side of the screen in the sidebar, under \'Code and automation\' there is an item named \'Pages\'.  Pick that.   Once there it\'s pretty easy.  Under \'Source\' there is a selector to pick the branch.   That should already say \'Deploy from a branch\'.   Leave that as it is.  Below that is a section labeled \'Branch\'.  In there are two buttons that should say \'None\' and \'Save\'.  It is not real obvious but click the \'None\' button and select the \'main\' branch\'.  Finally press the \'Save\' button.

When you have coded it, then use the desktop app to commit that and push it to your public repository.   </li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Once you have it working locally and have pushed it to the GitHub site you can actually create a \'GitHub Page\' to publish the working page for the whole world to see.   To do that when looking at the repository in GitHub.com, you will see a number of tabs along the top:  \'&lt;&gt; Code\', \'Issues\', ... \'Settings\'.   Pick the Settings.   It will automatically fill in the repository name, and the Default branch will probably be set to \'main\'.    On the left side of the screen in the sidebar, under \'Code and automation\' there is an item named \'Pages\'.  Pick that.   Once there it\'s pretty easy.  Under \'Source\' there is a selector to pick the branch.   That should already say \'Deploy from a branch\'.   Leave that as it is.  Below that is a section labeled \'Branch\'.  In there are two buttons that should say \'None\' and \'Save\'.  It is not real obvious but click the \'None\' button and select the \'main\' branch\'.  Finally press the \'Save\' button.   It should then tell you \'Your GitHub Pages site is currently being built from the&nbsp;<code>main</code>&nbsp;branch.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/\">Learn more about configuring the publishing source for your site</a>.\'  In a few moments you can refresh that page and see a note near the top that says something like \'Your site is live at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.github.io/Hello-World/\">https://michaelkentburns.github.io/Hello-World/</a>Last&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/Hello-World/actions/runs/7922504847\">deployed</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<img width=\"14\" height=\"14\" src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5041124?s=28&amp;v=4\" alt=\"@MichaelKentBurns\"><a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns\">MichaelKentBurns</a>&nbsp;1 minute ago\'.

It consists of the text to be presented interspersed with HTML markup tags that specify how that text should be displayed.   The filename usually ends in either .htm or .html to indicated that it can be displayed in a web browser.  The HTML markup standards have been around since the beginning of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web\">World Wide Web.</a>  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTML5</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5\">HTML5</a> is simply the 5th major revision of the HTML standards that added significant modern features that make some web pages very dynamic. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS\">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics.   While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale.   If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent.  Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish.   The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only.   A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives.   If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one.    A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database.  But, that is another subject for another day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript - A procedural programming language for web pages.</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript\">JavaScript</a> is a programming language inspired by Java that is meant to run inside a web page.   All of the actual work is performed by the web browser itself. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As discussed above, all of the above technologies can run on any computer with a web browser.

After reading this page and exploring FrontendMentor some, I recommend you try one of their challenges yourself.     </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another frontend learning site that is recommended is <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org\">freeCodeCamp</a>.  It not only has many good learning resources but it offers some significant certifications that will show what you have learned and practiced to potential employers or clients. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Looking ahead, in our page on <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/work-globally/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"59\">Work globally…</a> there is a challenge to do one of the FrontendMentor challenges and capture your process and final work in a GitHub repository that you can show off what you have learned.   Keep an eye out for that, as it is a very important step in your professional development. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML\">HTML</a> is a rich markup language which can be viewed and coded in a simple text editing program.   It consists of the text to be presented interspersed with HTML markup tags that specify how that text should be displayed.   The filename usually ends in either .htm or .html to indicated that it can be displayed in a web browser.  The HTML markup standards have been around since the beginning of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web\">World Wide Web.</a>  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTML5</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5\">HTML5</a> is simply the 5th major revision of the HTML standards that added significant modern features that make some web pages very dynamic. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS\">CSS</a> is a speciality language for styling text and graphics.   While simple HTML can be coded to create the desired look and layout it can be extremely tedious to do so on a large scale.   If you are not consistent then the look and feel will be inconsistent.  Furthermore, if you decide to change the way your site looks then you will have a monstrous job to adjust all of the tags from start to finish.   The intent of CSS is that the raw HTML page should contain the content only.   A single reference in the header of the page is made to a .css file that contains the styling directives.   If you choose to change the look and feel, then you can code a new css file and change the reference to point to the new one.    A further refinement of that idea is with a content management system (CMS) that stores the content in a database.  But, that is another subject for another day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript - A procedural programming language for web pages.</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript\">JavaScript</a> is a programming language inspired by Java that is meant to run inside a web page.   All of the actual work is performed by the web browser itself. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As discussed above, all of the above technologies can run on any computer with a web browser.  The HTML, CSS files and any embedded JavaScript code can be contained in a text file in a folder on the local computer.   You can test this yourself by creating a simple web page in a text editor (Notepad or TextEdit) and storing it on your hard drive.  Cut and paste this in your favorite text editor into a file called HelloWorld.htm:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then using your file browser (Windows explorer or Mac Finder) to locate that file and open it as you would any other document. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, that is all that is needed.  However, that does not make any use of the internet or the World Wide Web.   The \"World Wide\" part of the Web indicates that computers all over the world that are connected to the internet can work together to present a very dynamic universe of information and entertainment.    In order to connect your local computer to any web page in the World Wide Web you simply enter a web address such as <a href=\"http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm\">http://MichaelKentBurns.com/HelloWorld.htm</a> into the search or address bar of your browser.  The formal name for this address is a URL.  See the wikipedia page <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL\">A&nbsp;<strong>uniform resource locator</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>URL</strong>)</a> for details.  The first four characters stand for HyperText Transport Protocol which is one of several protocols as explained in the URL page.  After that the \':\' indicates the beginning of the location of the resource which usually starts with \'//\' followed by the name of the resource.   Try it yourself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What happened when you pressed return after that address is that your browser used that resource information to find the appropriate web server somewhere in the world (MichaelKentBurns.com) and request a specific page (HelloWorld.htm).  A web server program running on that computer located the file for that page and other associated information and sent it back to your browser running on your computer.  Your browser then formatted it according to the HTML rules and you then see the results.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If, however, you have saved a web page on your local hard drive you would access it using the \'file\' protocol with an address something like this: \"<a>file://C:/Michael/HelloWorld.htm</a>\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The details of that is for the next page (<a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/back-end-web/\">Back end web</a>).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Before you move on, remember this roadmap to your career</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A friend of mine who is a reader of this site has contributed a <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/about-michael/contributors/philemons-contributions/your-front-end-development-journey-a-step-by-step-roadmap/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"299\">roadmap to a Front-End development journey</a>.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Front end web','','inherit','closed','closed','','49-revision-v1','','','2024-03-30 17:56:32','2024-03-30 17:56:32','',49,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=308',0,'revision','',0),(309,1,'2024-04-01 20:14:29','2024-04-01 20:14:29','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From his review of my Frontend page:  <a href=\"https://michaelkentburns.com/index.php/your-front-end-development-journey-a-step-by-step-roadmap/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"299\">Your Front-End Development Journey: A Step-by-Step Roadmap</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Philemon\'s contributions','','inherit','closed','closed','','294-revision-v1','','','2024-04-01 20:14:29','2024-04-01 20:14:29','',294,'https://michaelkentburns.com/?p=309',0,'revision','',0),(310,1,'2024-04-01 20:24:12','2024-04-01 20:24:12','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Philemon Bahati has been a friend for over a year now and I had the pleasure of meeting him in person in April/May 2023 in Bukavu, DR Congo where he lives.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He has been actively reviewing this site and taking on challenges.
