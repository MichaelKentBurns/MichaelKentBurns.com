You don\'t need to understand all the details of SSL, but here\'s a brief explanation to get the basic idea:\r\nWhen you enter a URL, the protocol is either HTTP:// or HTTPS://. The \'S\' in HTTPS stands for secure. HTTP is not safe, while HTTPS is secure.\r\nWith HTTPS, your browser and the web server exchange certificates to establish a secure channel. If successful, your browser indicates a secure connection, usually with a lock icon. You can see this in action by visiting MichaelKentBurns.com.\r\n\r\nInsecure Connection\r\nTry visiting a site with \"http://\" in the URL. Notice the \'Insecure\' label in the address bar. Some sites automatically forward your request to HTTPS, but not all of them do.\r\n\r\nUncertain Site\r\nSometimes, a site has a certificate, but it\'s not fully validated. For example, visiting our demo site will show a warning, indicating an insecure connection. When you see this warning, take a moment to assess and proceed cautiously if necessary.\r\n\r\nChecking Certificates\r\nYou can use tools like SSLChecker to verify the details of a site\'s certificate. Try it with a site you rely on, such as Upwork.com or Google.com.\r\n\r\nYour Responsibility\r\nLook for the lock icon to ensure a secure connection.\r\nPay attention to warnings.\r\nIf in doubt, use SSLChecker or browser features to check the site.\r\nEnsure that your sites have valid certificates.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding Secure Connections\r\nWhen you connect to a website using HTTPS, your browser and the website exchange certificates. If everything checks out, your browser displays a secure connection indicator, often a lock icon, like those on MichaelKentBurns.com.\r\n\r\nNot All Secure Connections Are Equal: The Case of Unproven Certificates\r\nSometimes, website certificates might not be fully verified by your browser. In such cases, your browser will warn you.\r\nExample: Our demo site, https://demo.MichaelKentBurns.com, has a certificate but hasn\'t been fully validated yet. The first time you visit, you might see a strong warning instead of the website.\r\nDon\'t Ignore Warnings!\r\nHigh Commendation to Samuel: A student named Samuel encountered this warning and raised a concern, demonstrating excellent security awareness.\r\n\r\nEvaluate Warnings Carefully:\r\nDouble-check instructions.\r\nVerify if the site is low-risk.\r\nImportant accounts and high-risk sites should NEVER trigger warnings.\r\n\r\nAdvanced Options and Certificate Details\r\nMost browsers offer options to view detailed certificate information. You can also use SSL Checker, a website that allows you to enter any domain address and view its certificate details: https://www.sslchecker.com/sslchecker.\r\n\r\nWhat did you know about secure browsing before this lesson?\r\n\r\nI knew that using strong passwords and avoiding suspicious websites were important for secure browsing.\r\nI was familiar with the concept of HTTPS and its association with secure connections.\r\nWhat new information did you learn?\r\n\r\nThis lesson provided a deeper understanding of how secure connections work using SSL and certificates.\r\nI learned about the concept of mutual trust between a user and a website, and the importance of verifying both identities.\r\nIt was insightful to see how different browsers might display secure connection indicators and warnings regarding unverified certificates.\r\nHow will you stay secure online?\r\n\r\nI will prioritize using HTTPS websites whenever possible.\r\nI will be more vigilant about checking for secure connection indicators in my browser.\r\nI will be cautious when encountering warnings about unverified certificates and double-check the legitimacy of a site before proceeding.\r\nI will leverage resources like SSL checkers to verify the details of website certificates for important sites.\r\nWho shares the responsibility of checking website certificates?\r\n\r\nBoth users and website developers share the responsibility for secure browsing.\r\nUsers have a responsibility to be aware of secure connection indicators and warnings and to exercise caution when encountering suspicious websites.\r\nWebsite developers have a responsibility to ensure their websites have valid and up-to-date certificates to establish trust and protect user data.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/126.0.0.0','comment',0,0),(145,49,'Samuel BITINGINGWA','samuelbitingingwa@gmail.com','','206.42.84.244','2024-07-19 13:36:05','2024-07-19 13:36:05','I\'m so glad to learn web development on this site!\r\nAll lessons are orderly and it\'s what that make us learning step by step till at the end...',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36','comment',0,0),(150,52,'Samuel BITINGINGWA','samuelbitingingwa@gmail.com','','41.243.17.101','2024-07-21 13:40:38','2024-07-21 13:40:38','Interesting',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36','comment',0,0),(154,52,'Salomon Mwilo','salomonmwilo@gmail.com','','169.255.189.1','2024-07-25 21:54:55','2024-07-25 21:54:55','This is very helpful for beginners in web development.\r\nThank you for this knowledge in the backend  web, It helps us to get closer to our goal of learning web development.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36','comment',0,0),(161,52,'Théophile','achizatheophile@gmail.com','','169.239.159.52','2024-07-30 10:21:25','2024-07-30 10:21:25','I learned a lot about the Back end development part.

The transition from \"collecting snippets\" to embracing robust software design is crucial for long-term success. This post perfectly captures the importance of adopting a top-down approach in software development. It\'s not just about having the right tools; it\'s about understanding how to structure them to build something scalable, maintainable, and efficient. I\'ve seen firsthand how unstructured approaches can lead to fragile code, confusion, and unnecessary frustration. Starting with a clear vision of the architecture and breaking it down into manageable pieces, as suggested here, is the key to creating software that stands the test of time. I highly recommend every aspiring developer learn and apply software design principles early in their journey. Building a strong foundation from the beginning will save you time, effort, and headaches in the long run.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/132.0.0.0 Safari/537.36','comment',0,0),(537,2,'Luis Alves','intl.law7@aol.com','https://www.no-site.com','91.90.122.148','2025-02-04 11:03:40','2025-02-04 11:03:40','Dear Sir/Madam, \r\nIt is my utmost desire in engaging this moment to introduce to you myself as well our Firm. \r\nMy name is Luis Alves, a private investment Consultant.

Code snippets solve specific, isolated problems, while software design focuses on creating structured, scalable, and maintainable systems. As a student in web développement who started by experimenting code snippets, I completely understand the struggle of progressing from small, isolated tasks to larger, more structured projects. developper should Start by understanding the problem domain deeply and identifying the system\'s requirements. to Learn how to break down complex problems into smaller, modular components. This concept resonates deeply with me—becoming  a master in software development isn’t only just about writing functional code; it’s about crafting systems that are scalable, maintainable, and built to evolve. The point I like more about this article is “The top-down approach” I understand that it is essential to break down a complex problem into manageable components. By starting with a high-level overview and gradually decomposing it into detailed tasks, this method ensures clarity and organization throughout the development process. For that I suggest that a kind of picture or illustration for this process should be added to this part.\r\n\r\nhere is the link  of the kind of image i\'am sugesting \r\nhttps://files.prepinsta.com/2023/01/Topdown-SDLC-Approach-1024x728.webp',0,'0','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/132.0.0.0 Safari/537.36','comment',0,0);
