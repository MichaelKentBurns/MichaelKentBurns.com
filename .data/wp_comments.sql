You don\'t need to understand all the details of SSL, but here\'s a brief explanation to get the basic idea:\r\nWhen you enter a URL, the protocol is either HTTP:// or HTTPS://. The \'S\' in HTTPS stands for secure. HTTP is not safe, while HTTPS is secure.\r\nWith HTTPS, your browser and the web server exchange certificates to establish a secure channel. If successful, your browser indicates a secure connection, usually with a lock icon. You can see this in action by visiting MichaelKentBurns.com.\r\n\r\nInsecure Connection\r\nTry visiting a site with \"http://\" in the URL. Notice the \'Insecure\' label in the address bar. Some sites automatically forward your request to HTTPS, but not all of them do.\r\n\r\nUncertain Site\r\nSometimes, a site has a certificate, but it\'s not fully validated. For example, visiting our demo site will show a warning, indicating an insecure connection. When you see this warning, take a moment to assess and proceed cautiously if necessary.\r\n\r\nChecking Certificates\r\nYou can use tools like SSLChecker to verify the details of a site\'s certificate. Try it with a site you rely on, such as Upwork.com or Google.com.\r\n\r\nYour Responsibility\r\nLook for the lock icon to ensure a secure connection.\r\nPay attention to warnings.\r\nIf in doubt, use SSLChecker or browser features to check the site.\r\nEnsure that your sites have valid certificates.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding Secure Connections\r\nWhen you connect to a website using HTTPS, your browser and the website exchange certificates. If everything checks out, your browser displays a secure connection indicator, often a lock icon, like those on MichaelKentBurns.com.\r\n\r\nNot All Secure Connections Are Equal: The Case of Unproven Certificates\r\nSometimes, website certificates might not be fully verified by your browser. In such cases, your browser will warn you.\r\nExample: Our demo site, https://demo.MichaelKentBurns.com, has a certificate but hasn\'t been fully validated yet. The first time you visit, you might see a strong warning instead of the website.\r\nDon\'t Ignore Warnings!\r\nHigh Commendation to Samuel: A student named Samuel encountered this warning and raised a concern, demonstrating excellent security awareness.\r\n\r\nEvaluate Warnings Carefully:\r\nDouble-check instructions.\r\nVerify if the site is low-risk.\r\nImportant accounts and high-risk sites should NEVER trigger warnings.\r\n\r\nAdvanced Options and Certificate Details\r\nMost browsers offer options to view detailed certificate information. You can also use SSL Checker, a website that allows you to enter any domain address and view its certificate details: https://www.sslchecker.com/sslchecker.\r\n\r\nWhat did you know about secure browsing before this lesson?\r\n\r\nI knew that using strong passwords and avoiding suspicious websites were important for secure browsing.\r\nI was familiar with the concept of HTTPS and its association with secure connections.\r\nWhat new information did you learn?\r\n\r\nThis lesson provided a deeper understanding of how secure connections work using SSL and certificates.\r\nI learned about the concept of mutual trust between a user and a website, and the importance of verifying both identities.\r\nIt was insightful to see how different browsers might display secure connection indicators and warnings regarding unverified certificates.\r\nHow will you stay secure online?\r\n\r\nI will prioritize using HTTPS websites whenever possible.\r\nI will be more vigilant about checking for secure connection indicators in my browser.\r\nI will be cautious when encountering warnings about unverified certificates and double-check the legitimacy of a site before proceeding.\r\nI will leverage resources like SSL checkers to verify the details of website certificates for important sites.\r\nWho shares the responsibility of checking website certificates?\r\n\r\nBoth users and website developers share the responsibility for secure browsing.\r\nUsers have a responsibility to be aware of secure connection indicators and warnings and to exercise caution when encountering suspicious websites.\r\nWebsite developers have a responsibility to ensure their websites have valid and up-to-date certificates to establish trust and protect user data.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/126.0.0.0','comment',0,0),(145,49,'Samuel BITINGINGWA','samuelbitingingwa@gmail.com','','206.42.84.244','2024-07-19 13:36:05','2024-07-19 13:36:05','I\'m so glad to learn web development on this site!\r\nAll lessons are orderly and it\'s what that make us learning step by step till at the end...',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36','comment',0,0),(150,52,'Samuel BITINGINGWA','samuelbitingingwa@gmail.com','','41.243.17.101','2024-07-21 13:40:38','2024-07-21 13:40:38','Interesting',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36','comment',0,0),(154,52,'Salomon Mwilo','salomonmwilo@gmail.com','','169.255.189.1','2024-07-25 21:54:55','2024-07-25 21:54:55','This is very helpful for beginners in web development.\r\nThank you for this knowledge in the backend  web, It helps us to get closer to our goal of learning web development.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36','comment',0,0),(161,52,'Théophile','achizatheophile@gmail.com','','169.239.159.52','2024-07-30 10:21:25','2024-07-30 10:21:25','I learned a lot about the Back end development part.

The Title When reading this article, I started by trying to understand its purpose through the title. The title \"FROM CODE SNIPPETS TO SOFTWARE DESIGN: BUILDING ROBUST WEB APPLICATIONS\" clearly indicates that the article aims to guide beginner developers in their transition from using isolated code snippets to structured software design. The goal is to show how to move from a fragmented approach to a more global and thoughtful method for creating robust, reliable, and scalable web applications.\r\n2.	The Problems with Code Snippets The article begins by highlighting that beginners often tend to focus on writing small pieces of code (or \"snippets\") without understanding how these elements fit into a larger software design. This can lead to fragile applications that are difficult to maintain and evolve, resulting in a huge budget and dissatisfied clients. Analogously, this is like trying to build a house without a plan: the result may seem functional at first, but it will be unstable and difficult to modify or even finish.\r\n3.	The Importance of Software Design I\'ve understood, with the resources found on the page \"Working in team,\" that software design is an essential skill that beginners should acquire early in their journey. It allows you to:\r\n•	Structure code: Organize components in a logical and coherent manner.\r\n•	Facilitate maintenance: Make code easier to understand and modify.\r\n•	Ensure scalability: Allow the application to grow and adapt to new needs. By analogy, software design is like the architecture of a house. It defines the structure, foundations, and connections between the different parts, while coding corresponds to the actual construction.\r\n4.	The Pitfalls of the Code Snippet Approach The article warns against common problems associated with using code snippets without a global design:\r\n•	Fragile code: The code breaks easily when a change is made.\r\n•	Inconsistent behavior: Similar features may work differently, confusing users.\r\n•	Costly maintenance: Correcting errors or adding features becomes increasingly difficult.\r\n5.	The Solution: The Top-Down Approach The article proposes the \"top-down\" approach (from the general to the specific) as a solution. This involves:\r\n6.	Defining the overall architecture: Understanding the application\'s objectives and its main components.\r\n7.	Breaking down into modules: Dividing the application into smaller, more manageable parts.\r\n8.	Writing the code: Implementing each module following the established plan. Thus, without a global design, the fragments do not fit together harmoniously, leading to disorganized and difficult-to-maintain code. It would be like trying to solve a puzzle without knowing the final image: Some pieces can be assembled, but the result will probably be chaotic.\r\n9.	Conclusion: Why Software Design is Essential Software design is not an isolated skill: it is part of a set of skills that enable developers to succeed in a professional environment, whether in a team or as a freelancer. By moving from code snippets to a structured approach, developers can create robust, scalable, and easy-to-maintain applications.\r\n\r\nMy Experience: In a recent project, I worked on a web page using HTML and CSS, my goal was to create a responsive layout, but I ran into some issues because I had copied media queries found online and pasted them into my code without a clear plan. Initially, it seemed to work, but when testing on different screens, I realized that some CSS rules were conflicting, causing unpredictable behavior. If I had used a top-down approach, I would have first defined a global structure for my responsive design by identifying the essential breakpoints and organizing my styles progressively. Then, I would have applied the media queries consistently, ensuring that the code was clear and well-structured. This would have prevented inconsistencies and made it easier to maintain the project. This experience taught me that copying and pasting solutions without understanding the entire system can create more problems than it solves. In the future, I will take the time to design my code before implementing it.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/133.0.0.0 Safari/537.36','comment',0,0),(541,2,'Hairstyles','Floris78279@hotmail.com','https://www.hairstylesvip.com','183.30.185.204','2025-02-10 14:02:53','2025-02-10 14:02:53','I have realized that of all varieties of insurance, medical care insurance is the most marked by controversy because of the issue between the insurance cover company\'s obligation to remain profitable and the client\'s need to have insurance coverage.

It introduces the idea that software design is essential for creating robust applications.\r\nThis second article expands on that idea by presenting Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as a software design method that allows code to be organized in a structured and modular way. OOP is presented as a solution to avoid the pitfalls of fragmented code.\r\nThus, the second article answers the question \"How to do software design?\" by introducing OOP as a key approach.\r\nI share my understanding in four (4) key points:\r\n1. Understanding the World as Objects\r\nThrough a simple and effective analogy, the article explains how we have always learned to identify and classify objects in our environment based on their properties and behaviors. This way of thinking in terms of objects is fundamental to Object-Oriented Programming because it allows software to be organized in an intuitive and natural manner.\r\n2. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\r\nThe article explains that OOP consists of structuring a program into objects that have data (properties) and behaviors (methods). The goal is to organize code just like in real life—with entities that interact with each other.\r\nThe article emphasizes understanding the principles behind object-oriented design, giving the example of Smalltalk. While learning Smalltalk itself is not essential, the key takeaway is grasping object-oriented concepts. The article also differentiates between purely object-oriented languages and those that simply support objects.\r\n3. Why Use Object-Oriented Design?\r\nThe article presents several benefits of Object-Oriented Design:\r\nModularity: Code is organized into independent units, making project management easier.\r\n Reusability: An object can be reused in other parts of the program or even in other projects.\r\n Maintainability: Changes can be made more easily without breaking the entire system.\r\n Abstraction: One can use an object without needing to know all its internal details (e.g., driving a car without understanding the engine).\r\n4. Introduction to Object-Oriented Design Tools\r\nThe article mentions two essential tools for applying Object-Oriented Design:\r\n•	UML (Unified Modeling Language): A visual language used to graphically represent software architecture.\r\n•	CRC Cards (Class-Responsibility-Collaborator): A simple technique to think about and explore relationships between objects.\r\nMy Personal Experience with Object-Oriented Programming :\r\nI do not yet have experience with Object-Oriented Design in my personal projects. However, after reading this article, I now better understand why adopting an object-based approach from the beginning of development is important.\r\nIf I were to apply these concepts in a future project, I would start by identifying key objects and their relationships before writing any code. For example, in a website project, I could create classes for buttons, forms, and users, making my code more reusable and easier to maintain.\r\nThis reading has inspired me to explore Object-Oriented Programming further and experiment with concepts like encapsulation and inheritance in my future projects.\r\n\r\nSuggested Improvements :\r\n•	Add Concrete Examples in JavaScript: The example of Smalltalk is interesting, but as the article itself mentions, this language is rarely used today. Illustrating OOP concepts with JavaScript would make the article more accessible.\r\n•	Simplify the Section on UML and Metadata: The author\'s personal story is interesting, but it contains dense information and technical jargon (metadata, SCL, ModelCompiler). A beginner might struggle with these details and miss the connection to core OOP concepts.\r\nThanyou very much.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/133.0.0.0 Safari/537.36','comment',0,0),(552,764,'Efatha Rutakaza','efathabyamungu4@gmail.com','https://efatha.github.io/e-chat/','197.157.136.227','2025-02-24 12:04:06','2025-02-24 12:04:06','This article brilliantly highlights a common pitfall among new developers; the overreliance on scattered code snippets without a structured design approach.

Instead of focusing solely on isolated tasks, developers should prioritize understanding the overall system architecture. Planning before coding not only prevents technical debt but also ensures scalability and maintainability.\r\n\r\nI particularly appreciate the contrast between the Waterfall Model and top-down design, as it reinforces why adaptability is key in modern development. Emphasizing software design early on helps developers transition from basic coding to building robust applications.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to the next article on Thinking in Objects—an essential step in mastering structured software development!',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/133.0.0.0 Safari/537.36','comment',0,0),(553,773,'Efatha Rutakaza','efathabyamungu4@gmail.com','https://efatha.github.io/e-chat/','197.157.136.227','2025-02-24 13:11:58','2025-02-24 13:11:58','Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful way to structure code by thinking in terms of objects—just as we naturally recognize objects in the real world.

We can organize it in a way that mirrors how we naturally think about the world, by using \'objects.\' Think of an object like a specific \'thing\' – a car, a person, or a button on a screen. Each of these things has its own set of characteristics (like a car\'s color or a person\'s name) and actions it can perform (like a car driving or a person talking).\r\n\r\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) is all about building programs using these objects. It makes coding feel more natural because we’re working with concepts that are familiar to us. \r\n\r\nHere\'s why I think OOP is so useful:\r\nIt keeps things tidy: Each object is like its own little package, so you don\'t have to worry about one part of your code messing up another. \r\n\r\nIt saves you time: Once you\'ve created an object, you can reuse it in different parts of your program, or even in completely different projects. \r\n\r\nIt\'s easier to fix things: If you need to make changes, you can focus on the specific object that needs fixing without worrying about breaking everything else.\r\n\r\nIt simplifies complex stuff: Objects let you hide the complicated inner workings of something and just focus on what it does. It\'s like driving a car – you don\'t need to know how the engine works to use it.\r\n\r\nTo help plan and design these objects, I\'ve discovered tools like UML and CRC diagrams. These are like blueprints that help you visualize and organize your objects before you start writing code. It’s like planning a house before you start building it, making the whole process smoother and less chaotic.\r\n\r\nRegarding a project I\'ve been working on recently, here are some objects involved, their properties and behaviors. The project was to create a landing page with HTML and CSS.\r\n\r\nObjects (Elements) and Their Properties/Behaviors:\r\n1. HTML Document:\r\n* Properties:\r\n- font-size: Sets the base font size for the document (62.5% of the browser\'s default).\r\n- overflow-x: Prevents horizontal scrolling.\r\n- ::-webkit-scrollbar: Styles the browser\'s scrollbar.\r\n\r\n*Behaviors:\r\n- Scrollable (vertically).\r\n- Uses custom scrollbar styles.\r\n\r\n2. body (Document Body):\r\n* Properties:\r\n- background: Sets the background color to white (var(--white)).\r\n\r\n*Behaviors:\r\n- Container for all visible content.\r\n\r\n3. .Btn (Button Element):\r\n* Properties:\r\n- display: Inline-block, allowing for width/height adjustments.\r\n- padding: Adds space inside the button.\r\n- border: Defines the button\'s border.\r\n- background: Sets the background color to pink (var(--pink)).\r\n- color: Sets the text color to white.\r\n- font-size: Sets the text size.\r\n- border-radius: Creates rounded corners.\r\n- position: Relative, for positioning the pseudo-element.\r\n- overflow: Hidden, to clip the pseudo-element.\r\n- z-index: Manages stacking order.\r\n- margin-top: Adds space above the button.\r\n- max-width: Limits the width of the button.\r\n\r\n* Behaviors:\r\n- Clickable.\r\n- Has a hover effect (background color change).\r\n- Has an animated background effect on hover, using a before pseudo element.\r\n\r\n4. .header_top (Header Top Section):\r\n* Properties:\r\n- display: flex; : uses flexbox to align items.\r\n- align-items: center;: vertically aligns items.\r\n- justify-content: space-between;: distributes space between items.\r\n* Behaviors:\r\n- Arranges the logo and \"Try It Free\" button horizontally.\r\n\r\n5.

The analogy of a toddler recognizing a cat based on its properties (fur, tail, whiskers) and behaviors (purring, meowing, moving) illustrates how we naturally think in objects. This approach helps us break down complex systems into smaller, more manageable parts, making our code more maintainable, scalable, and reusable.\r\n\r\nStrengths of Part 2 – Thinking in Objects: Why Object-Oriented Design Matters\r\n	1.	Clear and Engaging Analogies\r\n	•	The analogy of how toddlers recognize objects based on properties and behaviors is an excellent way to introduce object-oriented thinking. It makes the concept intuitive, especially for readers new to OOP.\r\n	•	This approach aligns well with how developers should think about software design—breaking down complex systems into understandable, reusable parts.\r\n	2.	Good Justification for Object-Oriented Design\r\n	•	The article effectively explains why OOP is a natural fit for human cognition and problem-solving.\r\n	•	It highlights the benefits of structuring software in a way that mirrors real-world entities, making code more maintainable and scalable.\r\n\r\nAreas for Improvement\r\n	1.	More Practical Code Examples\r\n	•	While the theory is well-explained, the article would benefit from concrete examples of OOP in action.\r\n	•	A simple code snippet comparing procedural programming vs. OOP (e.g., defining a Car object in Python or Java) would make the discussion more actionable for readers.\r\n	2.	Stronger Transition Between Sections\r\n	•	Some transitions feel abrupt, especially when moving from cognitive psychology to Smalltalk’s role in OOP history.\r\n	•	Smoother progression, perhaps by introducing a section that bridges human thinking and actual software implementation, would improve the flow.\r\n\r\nIn my recent coding project, where I developed a webpage displaying two Bible passages per day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—I unknowingly applied some of these OOP principles. Now, with a better understanding of object-oriented design, I can analyze how different components of my project can be structured as objects with defined properties and behaviors.\r\n\r\nObjects in My Project\r\n\r\n1. The Page Object\r\n\r\nSince my project is a content-based web application, the webpage itself can be viewed as an object.\r\n	•	Properties:\r\n	•	title : The title of the webpage\r\n	•	date : The current date for selecting passages\r\n	•	morningPassage : The Bible passage displayed in the morning\r\n	•	afternoonPassage : The Bible passage displayed in the afternoon\r\n	•	theme : User-selected light or dark mode\r\n	•	Behaviors:\r\n	•	renderPassages() : Displays the Bible passages dynamically on the page\r\n	•	changeTheme(newTheme) : Updates the page’s appearance based on user preference\r\n	•	refreshPassages() : Reloads new passages when the day changes\r\n\r\n2. The User Object\r\n\r\nEven though my project does not require user authentication, considering the user’s interaction as an object helps structure the experience.\r\n	•	Properties:\r\n	•	preferences : Stores user settings (e.g., preferred theme)\r\n	•	lastVisit : The last time the user accessed the page\r\n	•	viewHistory : Keeps track of previously viewed passages\r\n	•	Behaviors:\r\n	•	savePreferences() : Stores the user’s theme preference in local storage\r\n	•	loadPreferences() : Applies the stored settings when the user revisits\r\n	•	trackVisit() : Updates the last visit date for future enhancements\r\n\r\n3. The Passage Object\r\n\r\nEach Bible passage displayed on the webpage can be treated as an object with specific attributes.\r\n	•	Properties:\r\n	•	text : The full passage text\r\n	•	reference : The book, chapter, and verse reference (e.g., John 3:16)\r\n	•	timeOfDay : Indicates whether it is a morning or afternoon passage\r\n	•	Behaviors:\r\n	•	display() : Shows the passage on the webpage\r\n	•	fetchNewPassage() : Retrieves a new passage when needed\r\n	•	highlightVerse() : Emphasizes key phrases for better readability\r\n\r\n4. The API Object (If fetching passages dynamically)\r\n\r\nIf my project evolves to fetch Bible passages from an API, an API object would be useful.\r\n	•	Properties:\r\n	•	apiURL : The URL of the Bible passage API\r\n	•	version : The Bible translation being used (e.g., KJV, NIV)\r\n	•	Behaviors:\r\n	•	fetchPassage(timeOfDay) : Retrieves a passage based on the time of day\r\n	•	parseResponse(response) : Processes the API response to extract the passage\r\n	•	handleErrors(error) : Manages errors when fetching data\r\n\r\nHow OOP Would Improve My Project\r\n\r\nThinking about my project in terms of objects, properties, and behaviors reveals areas for improvement. Right now, my code might be too procedural—mixing logic and UI interactions in the same script. If I refactored it using OOP, I could:\r\n\r\n*Make the code modular : Each object would handle its own responsibilities, reducing redundancy.\r\n*Improve maintainability : If I need to add features (like selecting different translations), I could extend the Passage object instead of modifying multiple scripts.\r\n*Enhance reusability : The same passage structure could be used for different display formats (e.g., a daily email or a mobile app).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nMichael Kent Burns’ discussion on object-oriented thinking has given me a new perspective on structuring my projects. I now see how breaking down a web application into logical objects makes development smoother, more efficient, and scalable.\r\n\r\nFor my next steps, I plan to:\r\n	•	Refactor my code to use classes and objects more effectively.\r\n	•	Separate UI logic from business logic for better organization.\r\n	•	Implement local storage to save user preferences persistently.\r\n	•	Explore API integration to dynamically fetch Bible passages.\r\n\r\nBy applying these OOP principles, my project will be more structured, maintainable, and ready for future improvements.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_2_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) CriOS/131.0.6778.154 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1','comment',0,0),(556,580,'Déogratias Mirindi','deomrd1@gmail.com','','45.221.7.18','2025-02-28 21:07:51','2025-02-28 21:07:51','Thank you, Michael, for this insightful post on web security.

The emphasis on their simplicity and accessibility is particularly valuable, as CRC cards offer a lightweight approach that does not require specialized tools or advanced technical expertise. This makes them an excellent starting point for teams looking to structure their software design collaboratively.\r\nThe article also highlights the collaborative and brainstorming aspects of CRC cards, which is one of their key strengths. By facilitating discussions among team members, they help identify key classes, responsibilities, and collaborations, making system structuring more intuitive. This approach is particularly beneficial for teams looking to improve communication and shared understanding in the early stages of development.\r\nAdditionally, the article mentions that CRC cards contribute to the early detection of design flaws, which is a major advantage since fixing issues later in development can be costly. However, providing more concrete examples of how CRC cards help uncover these flaws—such as missing responsibilities, excessive dependencies, or poorly defined classes—would further reinforce this point.\r\nWhile the article effectively presents the fundamental concepts, certain aspects could be expanded for greater clarity:\r\n•	Granularity of Responsibilities: The article does not specify whether responsibilities should be broad (e.g., “Manage Orders”) or more detailed (e.g., “Validate Shipping Address”). Clarifying this would help in properly structuring class responsibilities.\r\n•	Handling Complex Collaborations: It would be helpful to explain how to manage situations where a class interacts with multiple others, or indirectly through intermediary classes. For example, if Class A collaborates with B, which then collaborates with C, how should this be represented using CRC cards?\r\n•	Transitioning to Digital Tools: The article acknowledges that digital tools can complement CRC cards but does not specify when or how to transition, especially in large-scale projects. Providing practical guidance on this would be valuable.\r\n•	Evolving CRC Cards Throughout a Project: Since software design is constantly evolving, it would be useful to understand how to keep CRC cards up to date, manage conflicts, and ensure they remain aligned with the actual code.\r\n•	Integration with Other Object-Oriented Design Methods: CRC cards are a great initial tool, but how do they integrate with more formal methodologies such as UML? Exploring how CRC cards can serve as a foundation before transitioning to structured design models would be beneficial.\r\nAs a back-end developer, I find CRC cards particularly useful for structuring data entities and services. An effective approach involves:\r\n•	Identifying key entities that the back-end will manage, such as data models (e.g., Product, Order, Customer, Cart), and creating CRC cards for each.\r\n•	Defining class responsibilities related to data manipulation (e.g., \"Create a product,\" \"Update a product\") and modeling back-end services that orchestrate these operations.\r\n•	Mapping interactions with databases and APIs by using CRC cards for DAOs/Repositories, defining responsibilities (e.g., “Retrieve a product by ID,” “Save an order”) and identifying collaborators (e.g., the database or an ORM).\r\n•	Clarifying front-end expectations, using CRC cards to define API contracts and ensure necessary validations or data transformations are accounted for.\r\n•	Designing microservices efficiently, ensuring each service has a clearly defined responsibility and minimizing dependencies.\r\n•	Preparing the transition to UML, using CRC cards to lay the groundwork before formalizing the architecture with UML diagrams (e.g., class and sequence diagrams).\r\nFinally, it\'s crucial to follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to improve maintainability and consider design patterns, such as the Mediator pattern, to manage complex collaborations while reducing coupling.\r\nIn conclusion, this article effectively showcases the advantages of CRC cards as a simple, collaborative, and efficient tool for object-oriented design. However, adding practical insights on handling complex collaborations, adapting designs over time, and integrating CRC cards with other methodologies would further enhance its usefulness. For teams working on larger or more complex projects, these additional details would be essential for making the most of CRC cards in real-world applications.\r\n\r\nPractical Example: Using CRC Cards in a \"To-Do List\" Application\r\nTo illustrate the practical application of CRC cards in a real project, let’s take the example of a \"To-Do List\" application mentioned in the article. Here’s how you could approach the design of this project using CRC cards, leveraging the key points from the article and your back-end development expertise:\r\n\r\n1. Identifying Key Classes\r\nAs a back-end developer, you can start by identifying the main data entities and the services that will handle them. Some potential classes for a To-Do List application include:\r\n•	Task: Represents an individual task in the list.\r\n•	TaskList: Represents the complete list of tasks.\r\n•	User: Represents an application user.\r\n•	TaskService: A service responsible for managing task operations.\r\n\r\n2. Creating CRC Cards\r\nFor each identified class, create a CRC card and define its responsibilities and collaborators.\r\nExample CRC Card: \"Task\"\r\n•	Class: Task\r\n•	Responsibilities:\r\no	\"Set the task title\"\r\no	\"Set the task description\"\r\no	\"Mark the task as completed\"\r\no	\"Set the due date\"\r\n•	Collaborators:\r\no	TaskList (to add or remove the task from the list)\r\no	User (to associate the task with a specific user)\r\nExample CRC Card: \"TaskList\"\r\n•	Class: TaskList\r\n•	Responsibilities:\r\no	\"Add a task to the list\"\r\no	\"Remove a task from the list\"\r\no	\"Retrieve all tasks\"\r\no	\"Filter tasks by status (completed/incomplete)\"\r\n•	Collaborators:\r\no	Task (to manage individual tasks)\r\no	User (to associate a list with a specific user)\r\nExample CRC Card: \"TaskService\"\r\n•	Class: TaskService\r\n•	Responsibilities:\r\no	\"Create a task\"\r\no	\"Update a task\"\r\no	\"Delete a task\"\r\no	\"Retrieve a task by ID\"\r\n•	Collaborators:\r\no	Task\r\no	TaskList\r\no	Database (or DAO/Repository)\r\n\r\n3. Simulating Use Case Scenarios (\"Role-Playing\")\r\nUse CRC cards to simulate common usage scenarios and ensure the responsibilities and collaborations are correctly defined.\r\nScenario: \"A User Creates a New Task\"\r\n•	The user interacts with the interface (not modeled here).\r\n•	TaskService creates a new instance of Task.\r\n•	TaskService adds the new Task to the user’s TaskList.\r\nScenario: \"A User Marks a Task as Completed\"\r\n•	The user interacts with the interface.\r\n•	TaskService updates the Task status.\r\n•	TaskList is updated to reflect the new status.\r\n4. Identifying Missing Responsibilities and Collaborations\r\nDuring role-playing, you may identify missing responsibilities or incorrect collaborations. For example:\r\n•	You might realize that the Task class needs an additional responsibility to handle task priorities.\r\n5. Modeling Data Persistence\r\nAs a back-end developer, you need to consider data persistence. You can introduce a TaskDAO (Data Access Object) or a TaskRepository with responsibilities such as:\r\n•	\"Save a task to the database\"\r\n•	\"Retrieve a task by ID\"\r\n•	\"Update a task\'s status\"\r\n6. Collaboration with the Front-End (If Applicable)\r\nIf working with a front-end team, CRC cards can help define API contracts clearly. For example:\r\n•	What data should the front-end send to create a new task?\r\n•	What response format should the back-end return when displaying a task?\r\n7. Transitioning to More Formal Design Tools\r\nOnce the design is well-structured, you can use UML diagrams for documentation. This can include:\r\n•	Class Diagrams to represent relationships between classes.\r\n•	Sequence Diagrams to illustrate use case workflows.\r\nBy following this approach, we use CRC cards to collaboratively and iteratively design a To-Do List application, focusing on responsibilities and collaborations between classes. This helps build a well-structured, maintainable back-end that is easy to scale and integrate with other system components.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/132.0.0.0 Safari/537.36','comment',0,0),(560,784,'Michael Burns','MichaelKentBurns@gmail.com','https://MichaelKentBurns.com','97.139.101.120','2025-03-04 16:48:12','2025-03-04 16:48:12','I am going to approve a long comment by Ashuza.   His comment shows a great understanding of not only CRC cards and UML diagrams and their essential role in software design (from simple to very complex).   His comment clearly shows that software design is an extensive discipline that is essential even in simple projects.  \r\nI thank him for the effort and insight he invested. \r\n\r\nThat said, I want to make sure other readers don’t get stuck in their understanding by trying to internalize all that he said.   It is certainly a worthy read for those who are curious, but it’s too much to either expect our general reader to absorb, or to revise this article.  It should not be viewed as a criticism of Philemon’s article.    \r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that readers of this article need to understand the basics of CRC cards, and as the last two of Philemon’s paragraphs make clear: it is time to begin the long process of putting these tools to use.     The team is likely to begin a practical project using CRC cards.   Those cards will go through many iterations as they work as a team to understand the necessary design.

Overview and Key Takeaways\r\n\r\nThis section of the article provides a structured introduction to CRC (Class, Responsibility, and Collaborator) cards as a valuable tool for object-oriented design. It effectively highlights the practical benefits of using CRC cards during brainstorming and early-stage design, before transitioning to more formal modeling tools like UML.\r\n\r\nThe article emphasizes the tactile and collaborative nature of CRC cards, which facilitate a clearer understanding of relationships between different classes in a system. However, a few areas could benefit from further explanation, particularly regarding real-world applications and transitions to coding.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n\r\n✅ Simplification of Initial Design Process: CRC cards make the design process more interactive and dynamic before delving into complex modeling techniques like UML.\r\n\r\n✅ Real-World Example: The online store example with Customer, Order, Product, and ShoppingCart classes helps solidify understanding of object interactions within a software system.\r\n\r\n✅ Encourages Collaboration: The physical nature of CRC cards makes them particularly useful for team brainstorming sessions, allowing members to visualize relationships by moving cards around.\r\n\r\n✅ Bridging to UML: While CRC cards are useful for early design, a more explicit link between CRC cards and UML diagrams would help clarify the next steps in software development.\r\n\r\n2. Strengths and Helpful Insights\r\n\r\nConcise Explanation of CRC Cards The article provides a clear definition of CRC cards, explaining how they capture three key elements:\r\n\r\n* Class: The blueprint of an object.\r\n\r\n* Responsibilities: The actions it performs.\r\n\r\n* Collaborators: Other classes it interacts with.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly beneficial for beginners who may struggle with conceptualizing object-oriented principles.\r\n\r\nEffective Use of Examples The online store example is well-structured and includes essential class responsibilities such as:\r\n\r\nShoppingCart: “Add item,” “Remove item,” “Calculate total.”\r\n\r\nCustomer: “Place an order.”\r\n\r\nOrder: “Process payment.”\r\n\r\nThese examples effectively illustrate real-world object interactions. However, a more complex scenario (e.g., a library management system) could further demonstrate how CRC cards handle intricate relationships and dependencies.\r\n\r\nRemarkable Question: How do CRC cards scale when dealing with larger systems involving inheritance and polymorphism?\r\n\r\nPhysical Interaction as a Strength Highlighting the tactile nature of CRC cards (moving them around, grouping them) is an insightful approach, especially for team brainstorming sessions. However, the article does not fully explain how this process helps uncover missing relationships or flaws in object design.\r\n\r\nRemarkable Question: How does physically moving CRC cards help reveal missing interactions or errors in the design process?\r\n\r\nClarification Example:\r\n\r\nSuppose a Customer places an order. Moving the Customer card next to the ShoppingCart card may reveal a missing connection—should the ShoppingCart be linked to an Order before checkout?\r\n\r\nPhysically moving the cards forces developers to think critically about object relationships, improving design decisions.\r\n\r\nComparison Between Pen &amp; Paper vs. Digital Tools The article discusses the benefits of low-tech brainstorming before transitioning to structured digital tools like UML. This is crucial, as many developers rush into coding or software modeling without first conceptualizing relationships. However, the article could briefly mention tools like Miro or Trello for teams that collaborate remotely.\r\n\r\nRemarkable Question: What are the best digital tools for remote CRC card collaboration?\r\n\r\n3. Areas for Improvement and Unclear Points\r\n\r\nUnclear Explanation of Role-Playing Concept The role-playing approach—where developers act as objects and simulate interactions—is mentioned but not fully explained. A detailed walkthrough (e.g., how a Customer interacts with an Order) would make this concept more practical.\r\n\r\nRemarkable Question: How can role-playing with CRC cards improve team understanding of object behaviors?\r\n\r\nMore Emphasis on the Transition to UML The article briefly mentions UML but does not clearly explain how CRC cards translate into UML diagrams.\r\n\r\nRemarkable Question: What are the step-by-step stages from a CRC card to a UML class diagram?\r\n\r\nSuggested Enhancement:\r\n\r\nShow a before-and-after comparison of a CRC card and its equivalent UML diagram.\r\n\r\nExplain how responsibilities translate into methods and how collaborators become associations in UML.\r\n\r\nHow Do CRC Cards Translate into Code? The article does not discuss how CRC cards transition from design to actual implementation in code. Including an example would clarify this gap.\r\n\r\nRemarkable Question: How do CRC cards influence actual class structure in coding languages?\r\n\r\nExample Implementation in JavaScript:\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nclass Customer {\r\n    placeOrder(cart) {\r\n        let order = new Order(cart.items);\r\n        order.processPayment();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nHere, the Order class and ShoppingCart class (collaborators) appear as dependencies in the code, demonstrating how CRC card planning directly informs real-world software development.\r\n\r\n4. Key Questions and Suggested Enhancements\r\n\r\nHandling Inheritance and Polymorphism Remarkable Question: How do CRC cards represent parent-child relationships in object-oriented programming?\r\n\r\nSuggested Enhancement:\r\n\r\nProvide an example showing how subclasses can be represented using CRC cards (e.g., a base Payment class with CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment as subclasses).\r\n\r\nIterative Nature of CRC Cards CRC cards are often refined over multiple iterations as the design evolves. However, the article does not mention how to adapt CRC cards when new insights emerge.\r\n\r\nRemarkable Question: How can developers iterate on CRC cards to improve design clarity over time?\r\n\r\nSuggested Enhancement:\r\n\r\nShow an example of how CRC cards evolve from an initial draft to a refined design.\r\n\r\nNo Mention of CRC Limitations or Alternative Methods CRC cards are excellent for small-scale projects, but they may not be ideal for large-scale systems with numerous relationships. The article could briefly discuss when to switch from CRC cards to UML or database schema modeling.\r\n\r\nRemarkable Question: When do CRC cards become too simplistic, and what alternatives should developers consider?\r\n\r\n5. Conclusion and Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nOverall, this article effectively introduces CRC cards in a clear, simple, and engaging manner. The emphasis on hands-on interaction and real-world examples makes it accessible for beginners. However, a stronger connection to real coding, UML transitions, and iterative design would enhance understanding.\r\n\r\nNext Steps for Practical Application\r\n\r\nSince I believe in learning by doing, I plan to apply CRC cards to a to-do list application, sketching out potential classes and their responsibilities. I encourage others to try this exercise—it’s a great way to grasp the practical benefits of CRC cards before moving into digital modeling tools.\r\n\r\n* Experiment with CRC cards in your projects.\r\n\r\n* Explore how CRC cards can be adapted for remote collaboration using digital tools.\r\n\r\n* Practice translating CRC cards into code and UML diagrams to solidify your understanding.\r\n\r\nCRC cards are a powerful way to think in objects before diving into code. By using them effectively, developers can create cleaner, more maintainable architectures—which is an essential skill in modern software development.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/133.0.0.0 Safari/537.36','comment',0,0),(564,764,'Philemon Bahati','bahatiphilmon8@gmail.com','https://bahatiphilemon.netlify.app','102.223.131.52','2025-03-06 10:15:25','2025-03-06 10:15:25','Hey Salomon,\r\n\r\nWow, this is an incredibly thorough breakdown!

This means that Philemon did his job of explaining just the right amount.  \r\n\r\nIt\'s now time for the team to get hands on the job.   Bring your questions and ideas to the table and work as a team to start using the CRC cards.    It\'s a low tech way to get you thinking ahead.   \r\n\r\nYou asked about how CRC cards can be formalized and scaled up.  The simple answer is that they don\'t.  They were not meant to scale or get too formalized.     That is the job of UML.    \r\n\r\nI have proposed to Philemon that the team or at least part of it try a real world example using an application that you have already had some experience with.  My suggestion is the Demo application that the three of you did last year.   You already had the non design experience and got it working.    \r\n\r\nI will leave that to you all as a team to coordinate a project together.  Once you come to a consensus, you can propose what you plan to do and I\'ll write up an Upwork job for it.   \r\n\r\nIn doing that project you will learn starting with CRC cards and quickly move on to UML diagrams.  They scale well and are more easily modified and adapted as the design progresses.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/18.3 Safari/605.1.15','comment',563,1),(569,2,'Pallet','barb_lilley@yahoo.com','https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallet','104.207.45.69','2025-03-06 20:32:39','2025-03-06 20:32:39','I\'m not sure why but this weblog is loading incredibly slow for me.\r\n\r\nIs anyone else having this issue or is it a \r\nproblem on my end?

I\'d like to add a few points to your explanation:\r\n\r\nThe Importance of Thinking in Objects: As you mentioned, OOP encourages us to think about our code in terms of objects.  This is a fundamental shift in mindset that can be quite powerful.  By thinking about objects, we can better understand the relationships between different parts of our software and how they interact with each other.  This can lead to more intuitive and maintainable code.\r\n\r\nThe Role of Abstraction: You mentioned how OOP allows us to hide complexity through abstraction.  This is a crucial aspect of object-oriented design.  By abstracting away the details of how objects work, we can focus on their interfaces – the methods and properties that we can use to interact with them.  This makes our code easier to understand and use, even for developers who don\'t know the inner workings of the objects.\r\n\r\nBeyond OOP: While OOP is a powerful paradigm, it\'s not the only one.  Other approaches, such as functional programming, also have their own strengths and weaknesses.  It\'s important to be aware of these different approaches and choose the one that best suits your project and your own personal style.\r\n\r\nI\'m glad you found our article helpful.  If you have any further questions or would like to discuss any of these topics in more detail, please don\'t hesitate to ask.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/133.0.0.0 Safari/537.36','comment',553,5),(573,773,'Philemon Bahati','bahatiphilmon8@gmail.com','https://bahatiphilemon.netlify.app','102.223.131.27','2025-03-07 11:29:00','2025-03-07 11:29:00','Hi Theo,\r\n\r\nThanks for your thoughtful comment and for sharing your experience with object-oriented programming (OOP). You\'ve absolutely nailed the core concepts: OOP is indeed about organizing code in a way that mirrors real-world objects, making it more intuitive and maintainable. Your analogy of objects as \"little packages\" and your points about reusability, maintainability, and abstraction are spot-on!\r\n\r\nRegarding your project breakdown, you\'ve definitely approached the landing page development with an object-oriented mindset, recognizing the different elements as distinct entities with their own properties and behaviors. While your breakdown is very detailed and focused on the CSS properties and behaviors of the HTML elements, your interpretation of the HTML and CSS elements as objects is interesting.\r\n\r\nIn a strict OOP context, especially in languages like Java or C++, objects are more about encapsulating data and functionality together. In your example, you\'re primarily describing the visual properties and interactive behaviors defined by CSS. While CSS does allow for styling elements and adding interactive effects, it doesn\'t quite fulfill the complete encapsulation aspect of a traditional OOP object.\r\n\r\nHowever, your approach demonstrates a key aspect of good software design: recognizing and organizing components into manageable units. With the use of modern CSS frameworks that use the BEM or Atomic design principles, developers are able to componentize their CSS and HTML in a way that is very similar to OOP.\r\n\r\nYour breakdown is a good example of how to think in terms of components, and how to define their properties and behaviors. This is a crucial step towards understanding true object-oriented design.\r\n\r\nKeep exploring and experimenting! Your understanding of OOP will continue to deepen as you work on more complex projects and explore different programming paradigms.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/133.0.0.0 Safari/537.36','comment',554,5),(574,773,'Philemon Bahati','bahatiphilmon8@gmail.com','https://bahatiphilemon.netlify.app','102.223.131.1','2025-03-07 11:46:36','2025-03-07 11:46:36','Hi Samuel,\r\n\r\nThank you for your thoughtful and detailed feedback!

It serves as the blueprint for your software projects, providing a clear and structured way to represent both architecture and behavior through various diagrams. These visual representations are classified into two main categories:\r\n- **Structure Diagrams**: These diagrams effectively illustrate the static elements of your software, including individual components and their organization and connections. A prime example is the Class Diagram, which clearly depicts the objects within the system and their relationships.\r\n- **Behavior Diagrams**: Conversely, these diagrams focus on the dynamic aspects of your software, detailing how different components interact and how the system evolves over time. Sequence Diagrams, for instance, vividly visualize the order of events and the communication flow between objects.\r\nEmbracing UML offers significant advantages.
